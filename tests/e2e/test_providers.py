                Ah, yes, the question of *1 + 1*, a seemingly innocuous arithmetic inquiry, yet one that delves into the profound depths of mathematical philosophy, existential unity, and the nature of quantitative synthesis. In the realm of basic arithmetic, one could assert that 1 + 1 is merely the operation of addition, which, in a purely numerical sense, yields the sum of two distinct entities, both represented as the integer 1. But to confine this question to the confines of elementary mathematics would be an injustice to the broader metaphysical implications inherent within.
                When we contemplate the sum of two singularities, we are not simply combining two numerals; rather, we are engaging in the act of duality’s transcendence. The union of 1 and 1 signifies the coming together of discrete units into a new whole, which might symbolize the dialectical synthesis of opposites, the merger of individual selves into collective consciousness, or the confluence of two rivers of thought flowing into the great ocean of mathematical totality.
                From a set-theoretic perspective, we might consider that the set {1} is the first element, and the operation of union with another identical set of {1} would yield the set {1, 1}, which, upon the realization of the cardinality of this set, reveals itself to be equivalent to the set {1}, pointing to an inherent paradox within the very concept of addition.
                Thus, while the answer to the numerical question "What is 1 + 1?" may, in its most banal form, be 2, we must consider the profound ontological implications of this operation as we venture into the realm of metaphysical arithmetic, where numbers transcend their numerical limitations and dance upon the threshold of the infinite.
