Okta Verify and Beyond Identity were installed and connected to Snowflake profile. A Snowflake key was installed and available in SamsungPass and it connected to Okta in my Mac.

After the Beyond Identity step Okta insisted I had to provide a security token or biometric ID. Trying to go through the steps on that, it gave me a QR code which I had no way of scanning. I eventually fixed it by removing my MacBook Touch ID from the biometric authenticator section on the Okta security methods page. Retrying the Slack login then gave me the option of adding my phone as an\nauthenticator, which allowed Slack to connect from my phone.

It makes it easy to get a group of people together for discussions, use channels to share context with a broad audience, and directly reach out to anyone in the company\u2014this can be incredibly valuable if you\u2019re stuck and need help getting unblocked.\nHowever, when used poorly, Slack can also make us less efficient. What follows is guidance on how to keep Slack a great communication tool for you and everyone you work with.\nManage Notifications\nSlack allows you to configure notifications to minimize unwelcome interruptions. You can mute conversations (https://slack.com/help/articles/204411433-Mute-channels-and-direct-messages), unfollow threads (https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-#follow-or-unfollow-a-thread), and use Do Not Disturb (https://slack.com/help/articles/214908388-Pause-notifications-with-Do-Not-Disturb) to temporarily pause all notifications. Take advantage of these and other available options (https://slackhq.com/how-to-customize- notifications-in-slack) based on your preferences. -\nMost messages don\u2019t need an immediate response. When you get a notification, check if the accompanying message is urgent, e.g., a request for your help during an outage. If so, respond right away, otherwise consider marking the message unread (https://slack.com/help/articles/217626598-Get-around-faster-with-keyboard-\nshortcuts#:~:text=Mark%20messages%20as%20unread,-"", ""source"": ""Information_Technology_IT_Slack_Etiquette"", ""source_id"": 1, ""presigned_url"": null}, {""index"": 2, ""excerpt"": ""https://lift.snowflake.com/kb_view.do?sys_kb_id=31f0236f8779ca18b7daea8f8bbb3526\n2/4\n5/10/24, 2:58 PM\nInformation Technology (IT) - Slack Etiquette\nOptimize for Efficiency\nSlack allows you to customize your sidebar in a variety of ways, including: reducing visual clutter by only showing unread messages (https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize-conversations-with-custom-sections#manage- conversation-display); and organizing conversations (https://slack.com/help/articles/360043207674-Organize- conversations-with-custom-sections) by starring them or creating custom sections. Consider these options if you\u2019re interested in making your sidebar more manageable. Also, if there are channels you don\u2019t actively participate in, leaving them can be a good way to trim your sidebar.\nSlack supports a variety of slash commands (https://slack.com/help/articles/201259356-Use-built-in-slash-commands) and keyboard shortcuts (https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts) to facilitate efficiency, e.g., Cmd + K to bring up the Quick Switcher. If you spend a decent amount of time on Slack, consider learning some of these tricks. It will pay off in saved time and effort.\nMake Each Other The Best Slack Users\nIt is completely appropriate to point out inconsiderate Slack use as long as you do so respectfully. In particular, don\u2019t hesitate to let people know if they\u2019re doing something that\u2019s drawing your attention more than necessary, e.g., messaging you directly when posting in a channel (like #product) might be more appropriate. Conversely, be open to receiving feedback about your own Slack habits as well. We need to be comfortable with holding each other accountable and that is how we\u2019ll make each other the best.\nNote On Channels Meant For FTE Use Only"", ""source"": ""Information_Technology_IT_Slack_Etiquette"", ""source_id"": 1, ""presigned_url"": null}, {""index"": 3, ""excerpt"": ""Craft your messages thoughtfully for quick and easy comprehension. In particular, be concise, proofread before posting, and use formatting (https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) when appropriate. This applies both to channel-wide and direct communication.\nOne particularly good practice is to synthesize multiple thoughts into a single multi-line message instead of posting individual thoughts as separate messages. This minimizes notifications and makes the reader\u2019s life easier. In particular, don\u2019t send messages like \u201chello\u201d or \u201cyou there?\u201d and then wait for a response before asking your question; either skip these messages altogether or include them in the same message as your request, using new lines if necessary.

Consider following this practice when appropriate. It communicates the same sentiment but without the extra message or notification.\nIf you\u2019re interested in general tips on tone, grammar and writing for accessibility, the Mailchimp content style guide (https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/tldr/) is a good resource.\nUse Threads"", ""source"": ""Information_Technology_IT_Slack_Etiquette"", ""source_id"": 1, ""presigned_url"": null}]",3724,"[

Someone send you an email but you can\u2019t find it? Are you getting a lot of unsolicited email and wondering how to eliminate it? Read on for some tips and tricks to keeping your email organized and going to the right place based on your preferences.\nManaging Email\nGmail offers tabbed inboxes, and these can be helpful for those who like to keep their primary inbox free of unsolicited email. Clean primary inboxes help you focus on what matters. When enabled, tabs appear at the top of your inbox, where you can quickly move between them. You should continue to check emails in the tabs daily because Gmail sometimes gets it wrong and important emails can end up in one of the other tabs such as Promotions or Social.\nIf you wantto turn on tabs, read on...\nTurn on tabs for email that you want to move out of your primary inbox. For example, if you turn on the Promotions tab, Gmail moves any existing promotional email from your inbox to the Promotions tab. Any new promotional messages go directly to the Promotions tab.\nNOTE: You'll still want to check your Promotions tab regularly to ensure you have not missed an important message.\n1. At the top right, click Settings See all settings.\n2. At the top, click Inbox.\n3. Next to Inbox type, select Default.\nNote: To hide all tabs, select another inbox type.\n4. Under Categories, check the boxes of the tabs that you want to see:\nPrimary\u2014Email from people that you know and any other messages that don\u2019t appear in other tabs.\nSocial\u2014Messages from social networks, media-sharing sites, and other social websites.\nPromotions\u2014Deals, offers, and other promotional email."", ""source"": ""Information_Technology_IT_Gmail_Tips_and_Tricks"", ""source_id"": 2, ""presigned_url"": null}]",3920,"[

For example, if your Prod VPN login ID is ""ymatsuzaki@int.snowflakecomputing.com"", then your GitHub username should be ""sfc-gh-ymatsuzaki"".

- The claim that AppCleaner can interfere with or block the company-installed antivirus software is supported by Source ID: 1, which states that AppCleaner is explicitly disallowed because file deletion can interfere with antivirus software.
- The recommendation to follow OS-native procedures for software removal on Mac and Windows is also supported by Source ID: 1, which lists OS-native software removal procedures as the approved potential alternatives.

Reasoning:
Chunk 1: The passage states that the different reactions available for a video call include showing red hearts, balloons, a thumbs up emoji, a thumbs down emoji, stormy rain, confetti, fireworks, and laser beams. It also mentions that these can be activated using specific hand gestures or by clicking the corresponding button in the Reactions submenu. The citation 【†1†】 supports all these claims by providing detailed information on how each reaction can be activated either through hand gestures or by clicking the corresponding button in the Reactions submenu.

See attachment. Instead, it should be validated by FIDO. Biometrics were configured and enabled in my new cell phone. Okta Verify and Beyond Identity were installed and connected to Snowflake profile. A Snowflake key was installed and available in SamsungPass and it connected to Okta in my Mac. I even used Chrome on my phone. The only thing that worked for me was to insert the Mac Yubikey in my cell phone's USB-C. But it shouldn't be like that.\nPosted by Jiaming Fu 7 months ago I ran into the same issue. Follow the FIDO2 settings instruction in the beginning of the article and it worked.\nPosted by Steven Smith 9 months ago\nI had trouble with this at first. After the Beyond Identity step Okta insisted I had to provide a security token or biometric ID. Trying to go through the steps on that, it gave me a QR code which I had no way of scanning. I eventually fixed it by removing my MacBook Touch ID from the biometric authenticator section on the Okta security methods page. Retrying the Slack login then gave me the option of adding my phone as an\nauthenticator, which allowed Slack to connect from my phone. Once Slack was properly connected, I could re- add my MacBook fingerprint authenticator without breaking anything.\nPosted by Gaurav Nuti 06-05-2023 01:01:22 PM I did not see the step 10, I was directly logged in\nPosted by Yiren Zhou 02-10-2023 08:41:45 AM"", ""source"": ""Information_Technology_IT_How_to_login_to_Slack_on_your_Phone"", ""source_id"": 2, ""presigned_url"": null}]",4159,"[
