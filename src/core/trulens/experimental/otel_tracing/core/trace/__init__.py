"""
Modules in this folder depend on each other which makes it impossible to import
them without circular import errors. Because of this, some imports need to be
put into `if TYPE_CHECKING` blocks and classes that depend on those imports need
to be "rebuilt" with `model_rebuild`. This only applies to `pydantic.BaseModel`
classes. Type hints on non-pydantic classes are never interpreted hence no need
to "rebuild" those.
