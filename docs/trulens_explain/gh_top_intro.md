## TruLens-Explain

**TruLens-Explain** is a cross-framework library for deep learning
explainability. It provides a uniform abstraction over a number of different
frameworks. It provides a uniform abstraction layer over TensorFlow, Pytorch,
and Keras and allows input and internal explanations.

### Installation and Setup

These installation instructions assume that you have conda installed and added
to your path.

0. Create a virtual environment (or modify an existing one).

```bash
conda create -n "<my_name>" python=3  # Skip if using existing environment.
conda activate <my_name>
```

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
conda install tensorflow-gpu=1  # Or whatever backend you're using.
conda install keras             # Or whatever backend you're using.
conda install matplotlib        # For visualizations.
```

2. [Pip installation] Install the trulens pip package from PyPI.

```bash
pip install trulens
```

#### Installing from Github

To install the latest version from this repository, you can use pip in the following manner:

```bash
pip uninstall trulens -y # to remove existing PyPI version
pip install git+https://github.com/truera/trulens#subdirectory=trulens_explain
```

To install a version from a branch BRANCH, instead use this:

```bash
pip uninstall trulens -y # to remove existing PyPI version
pip install git+https://github.com/truera/trulens@BRANCH#subdirectory=trulens_explain
```
