    "TruLens is a framework that helps you instrument and evaluate LLM apps including\n",
    "RAGs and agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because TruLens is tech-agnostic, we offer a few different tools for\n",
    "instrumentation.\n",
    "* TruCustomApp gives you the most power to instrument a custom LLM app, and\n",
    "  provides the `instrument` method.\n",
    "* TruBasicApp is a simple interface to capture the input and output of a basic\n",
    "  LLM app.\n",
    "* TruChain instruments LangChain apps. [Read\n",

    "## Instrumenting LLM applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating LLM applications often requires access to the internals of an app,\n",
    "such as retrieved context. To gain access to these internals, TruLens provides\n",
    "the `instrument` method. In cases where you have access to the classes and\n",
    "methods required, you can add the `@instrument` decorator to any method you wish\n",
    "to instrument. See a usage example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `@instrument` decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from trulens.tru_custom_app import instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "class RAG_from_scratch:\n",
    "    @instrument\n",
    "    def retrieve(self, query: str) -> list:\n",

    "        Retrieve relevant text from vector store.\n",

    "    @instrument\n",

    "is via `instrument.method`. See a usage example below:\n",
