# Anatomy of Feedback Functions

The `Feedback` class contains the starting point for feedback function
specification and evaluation. A typical use-case looks like this:

```python
# Context relevance between question and each context chunk.
f_context_relevance = (
    Feedback(provider.context_relevance_with_cot_reasons, name = "Context Relevance")
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.args.query)
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.rets)
    .aggregate(numpy.mean)
)
```

The components of this specifications are:

## Feedback Providers

The provider is the back-end on which a given feedback function is run.
Multiple underlying models are available througheach provider, such as GPT-4 or
Llama-2. In many, but not all cases, the feedback implementation is shared
cross providers (such as with LLM-based evaluations).

## Feedback implementations

`openai.context_relevance` is an example of a feedback function implementation.

Feedback implementations are simple callables that can be run
on any arguments matching their signatures. In the example, the implementation
has the following signature:

```python
def context_relevance(self, prompt: str, context: str) -> float:
```

That is, `context_relevance` is a plain python method that accepts the prompt and
context, both strings, and produces a float (assumed to be between 0.0 and
1.0).

## Feedback constructor

The line `Feedback(openai.relevance)` constructs a
Feedback object with a feedback implementation.

## Argument specification

The next line, `on_input_output`, specifies how
the `language_match` arguments are to be determined from an app record or app
definition. The general form of this specification is done using `on` but
several shorthands are provided. For example, `on_input_output` states that the first two
argument to `relevance` (`prompt` and `response`) are to be the main app input
and the main output, respectively.

## Aggregation specification

The last line `aggregate(numpy.mean)` specifies
how feedback outputs are to be aggregated. This only applies to cases where
the argument specification names more than one value for an input. The second
specification, for `statement` was of this type. The input to `aggregate` must
be a method which can be imported globally. This requirement is further
elaborated in the next section. This function is called on the `float` results
of feedback function evaluations to produce a single float. The default is
`numpy.mean`.
