# Feedback Selectors

Feedback selection is the process of determining which components of your
application to evaluate.

This is useful because today's LLM applications are increasingly complex.
Chaining together components such as planning, retrievel, tool selection,
synthesis, and more; each component can be a source of error.

This also makes the instrumentation and evaluation of LLM applications inseparable.
To evaluate the inner components of an application, we first need access to them.

As a reminder, a typical feedback definition looks like this:

```python
f_lang_match = Feedback(hugs.language_match)
    .on_input_output()
```

`on_input_output` is one of many available shortcuts to simplify the selection
of components for evaluation. We'll cover that in a later section.

The selector, `on_input_output`, specifies how the `language_match` arguments
are to be determined from an app record or app definition. The general form of
this specification is done using `on` but several shorthands are provided.
`on_input_output` states that the first two argument to `language_match`
(`text1` and `text2`) are to be the main app input and the main output,
respectively.

This flexibility to select and evaluate any component of your application allows
the developer to be unconstrained in their creativity. **The evaluation
framework should not designate how you can build your app.**
