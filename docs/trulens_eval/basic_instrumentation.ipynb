    "TruLens provides a number of different instrumentation frameworks to allow you to inspect and evaluate the internals of your application and its associated records. In any framework you can track a wide variety of usage metrics and metadata, detailed below, along with the inputs and outputs of the application. For frameworks with deep integrations, TruLens can expose additional internals of the application for tracking.\n",

    "* Timestamp (ts) - automatcially tracked, the timestamp of the application call\n",
