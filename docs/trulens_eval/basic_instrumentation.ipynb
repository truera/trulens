    "TruLens provides a number of different instrumentation frameworks to allow you to inspect and evaluate the internals of your application and its associated records. In any framework you can track a wide variety of usage metrics and metadata, detailed below, along with the inputs and outputs of the application. For frameworks with deep integrations, TruLens can expose additional internals of the application for tracking.\n",

    "* In streaming mode, number of chunks produced (n_stream_chunks)\n",
    "* Number of prompt tokens supplied (n_prompt_tokens)\n",
    "* Number of completion tokens generated (n_completion_tokens)\n",
    "* Cost in USD (cost)\n",

    "### **App Metadata**\n",
    "* App ID (app_id) - user supplied string or automatically generated hash\n",
    "* Tags (tags) - user supplied string\n",
    "* Model metadata - user supplied json\n",

    "### **Record Metadata**\n",
    "* Record ID (record_id) - automatically generated, track individual application calls\n",
    "* Timestamp (ts) - automatcially tracked, the timestamp of the application call\n",
    "* Latency (latency) - the difference between the application call start and end time."
