# TruLens for LLM Agents

This section highlights different end-to-end use cases that TruLens can help with when building LLM agent applications. For each use case, we not only motivate the use case but also discuss which components are most helpful for solving that use case.

    Verify that your agent uses the intended tools and check it against business requirements.

!!! info "[Detect LLM Agent Tool Gaps/Drift](https://colab.research.google.com/github/truera/trulens/blob/main/examples/expositional/frameworks/langchain/langchain_agents.ipynb)"
    Identify when your LLM agent is missing the tools it needs to complete the tasks required.
