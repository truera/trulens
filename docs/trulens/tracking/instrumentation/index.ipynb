    "TruLens is a framework that helps you instrument and evaluate LLM apps including\n",
    "RAGs and agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because TruLens is tech-agnostic, we offer a few different tools for\n",
    "instrumentation.\n",
    "* TruCustomApp gives you the most power to instrument a custom LLM app, and\n",
    "  provides the `instrument` method.\n",
    "* TruBasicApp is a simple interface to capture the input and output of a basic\n",
    "  LLM app.\n",
    "* TruChain instruments LangChain apps. [Read\n",

    "## Instrumenting LLM applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating LLM applications often requires access to the internals of an app,\n",
    "such as retrieved context. To gain access to these internals, TruLens provides\n",
    "the `instrument` method. In cases where you have access to the classes and\n",
    "methods required, you can add the `@instrument` decorator to any method you wish\n",
    "to instrument. See a usage example below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `@instrument` decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from trulens.core.app.custom import instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "class RAG_from_scratch:\n",
    "    @instrument\n",
    "    def retrieve(self, query: str) -> list:\n",

    "In cases you do not have access to a class to make the necessary decorations for\n",
    "tracking, you can instead use one of the static methods of instrument, for\n",
    "example, the alternative for making sure the custom retriever gets instrumented\n",
    "is via `instrument.method`. See a usage example below:\n",
