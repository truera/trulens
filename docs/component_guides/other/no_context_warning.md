# "Cannot find TruLens context" Warning/Error

```
Cannot find TruLens context. See
https://www.trulens.org/component_guides/other/no_context_warning for more information.
```

If you see this warning/error, _TruLens_ attempted to execute an instrumented
method in a context different than the one in which your app was instrumented. A
different context here means either a different `threading.Thread` or a
different `asyncio.Task`. While we include several remedies to this problem to
allow use of threaded and/or asynchronous apps, these remedies may not cover all
of the cases. This document is here to help you fix the issue in case your app
or the libraries you use were not covered by our existing remedies.

## Threads

If using threads, use the replacement threading classes included in _TruLens_
that stand in place of python classes:

- [trulens.core.utils.threading.Thread][trulens.core.utils.threading.Thread]
  instead of [threading.Thread][threading.Thread].

- [trulens.core.utils.threading.ThreadPoolExecutor][trulens.core.utils.threading.ThreadPoolExecutor]
  instead of
  [concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor][concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor].

You can also import either from their builtin locations as long as you import
_TruLens_ first.

Alternatively, use the utility methods in the [TP
class][trulens.core.utils.threading.TP] such as
[submit][trulens.core.utils.threading.TP.submit].

Alternatively, target [Context.run][contextvars.Context.run] in your threads,
with the original target being the first argument to `run`:

```python
from contextvars import copy_context

# before:
Thread(target=your_thread_target, args=(yourargs, ...), kwargs=...)

# after:
Thread(target=copy_context().run, args=(your_thread_target, yourargs, ...), kwargs=...)
```

## Async Tasks

If using async Tasks, make sure that the default `copy_context` behaviour of
`Task` is being used. This only applies to python >= 3.11:

```python
from contextvars import copy_context
from asyncio import get_running_loop

loop = get_running_loop()

# before:
task = loop.create_task(your_coroutine, ..., context=...)

# after:
task = loop.create_task(your_coroutine, ..., context=copy_context())
# or:
task = loop.create_task(your_coroutine, ...) # use default context behaviour
```

If you are using python prior to 3.11, `copy_context` is the fixed behaviour
which cannot be changed.

## Other issues

If you are still seeing the _Cannot find TruLens context_ warning and none of the solutions
above address the problem, please post a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/truera/trulens/issues) or a slack post on the
[AIQuality Forum](https://communityinviter.com/apps/aiqualityforum/josh).
