# ðŸ¦´ Anatomy of Feedback Functions

The [Feedback][trulens.core.Feedback] class contains the
starting point for feedback function specification and evaluation. A typical
use-case looks like this:

```python
# Context relevance between question and each context chunk.
f_context_relevance = (
    Feedback(
        provider.context_relevance_with_cot_reasons,
        name="Context Relevance"
    )
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.args.query)
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.rets)
    .aggregate(numpy.mean)
)
```

The components of this specifications are:

## Feedback Providers

The provider is the back-end on which a given feedback function is run.
Multiple underlying models are available througheach provider, such as GPT-4 or
Llama-2. In many, but not all cases, the feedback implementation is shared
cross providers (such as with LLM-based evaluations).

Read more about [feedback providers][trulens.core.feedback.provider.Provider].

## Feedback implementations

[OpenAI.context_relevance][trulens.providers.openai.provider.OpenAI.context_relevance]
is an example of a feedback function implementation.

Feedback implementations are simple callables that can be run
on any arguments matching their signatures. In the example, the implementation
has the following signature:

```python
def context_relevance(self, prompt: str, context: str) -> float:
```

That is,
[context_relevance][trulens.providers.openai.provider.OpenAI.context_relevance]
is a plain python method that accepts the prompt and context, both strings, and
produces a float (assumed to be between 0.0 and 1.0).

## Feedback constructor

The line `Feedback(openai.relevance)` constructs a
Feedback object with a feedback implementation.

## Argument specification

The next line,
[on_input_output][trulens.core.Feedback.on_input_output],
specifies how the
[context_relevance][trulens.providers.openai.OpenAI.context_relevance]
arguments are to be determined from an app record or app definition. The general
form of this specification is done using
[on][trulens.core.Feedback.on] but several shorthands are
provided. For example,
[on_input_output][trulens.core.Feedback.on_input_output]
states that the first two argument to
[context_relevance][trulens.providers.openai.OpenAI.context_relevance]
(`prompt` and `context`) are to be the main app input and the main output,
respectively.

specification](./feedback_selectors/selecting_components.md) and [selector
shortcuts](./feedback_selectors/selector_shortcuts.md).

## Aggregation specification

The last line `aggregate(numpy.mean)` specifies how feedback outputs are to be
aggregated. This only applies to cases where the argument specification names
more than one value for an input. The second specification, for `statement` was
of this type. The input to
[aggregate][trulens.core.Feedback.aggregate] must be a method
which can be imported globally. This requirement is further elaborated in the
next section. This function is called on the `float` results of feedback
function evaluations to produce a single float. The default is
[numpy.mean][numpy.mean].
