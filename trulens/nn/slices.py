"""
The *slice*, or layer, of the network provides flexibility over the level of 
abstraction for the explanation. In a low layer, an explanation may highlight 
the edges that were most important in identifying an object like a face, while 
in a higher layer, the explanation might highlight high-level features such as a
nose or mouth. By raising the level of abstraction, explanations that generalize
over larger sets of samples are possible.

Formally, A network, $f$, can be broken into a slice, $f = g \\circ h$, where 
$h$ can be thought of as a pre-processor that computes features, and $g$ can be
thought of as a sub-model that uses the features computed by $h$.
