# Examples

The top-level organization of this examples repository is divided into
**quickstarts** and **expositions**. Quickstarts are actively maintained to work
with every release. Expositional examples focus on using TruLens with different
data sources, models, frameworks and more. They are generally sorted by the type
of integration youâ€™re looking to use.

Quickstarts contain the simple examples for critical workflows to build,
evaluate and track your LLM app.

This expositional library of TruLens examples is organized by the component of
interest. Components include `/models`, `/frameworks` and `/vector-dbs`.

For end to end application examples, checkout `/end2end_apps`.
