# Examples

The top-level organization of this examples repository is divided into
**quickstarts**, **expositions**, **experimental**, and **dev**. Quickstarts are
actively maintained to work with every release. Expositions are verified to work
with a set of verified dependencies tagged at the top of the notebook which will
be updated at every *major* release. Experimental examples may break between
release. Dev examples are used to develop or test releases.

Quickstarts contain the simple examples for critical workflows to build,
evaluate and track your LLM app. These examples are displayed in the
TruLens documentation under the "Getting Started" section.

This expositional library of TruLens examples is organized by the component of
interest. Components include `/models`, `/frameworks` and `/vector-dbs`.
Use cases are also included under `/use_cases`. These examples can be found
in TruLens documentation as the TruLens cookbook.
