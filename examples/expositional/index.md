# 🧑‍🍳 TruLens Cookbook

Examples for tracking and evaluating apps with _TruLens_. Examples are organized by different frameworks (such as LangChain or Llama-Index), model (including Azure, OSS models and more), vector store, and use case.

The examples in this cookbook are more focused on applying core concepts to external libraries or end to end applications than the [quickstarts](../trulens/getting_started/quickstarts/quickstart/).
