    "## Automatic @task Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key features of TruGraph is its ability to automatically detect and instrument functions decorated with LangGraph's `@task` decorator. This means you can use standard LangGraph patterns without any additional instrumentation code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Detection**: TruGraph automatically scans for functions decorated with `@task`\n",
    "2. **Smart Attribute Extraction**: It intelligently extracts information from function arguments:\n",
    "   - Handles `BaseChatModel` and `BaseModel` objects\n",
    "   - Extracts data from dataclasses and Pydantic models\n",
    "   - Skips non-serializable objects like LLM pools\n",
    "   - Captures return values and exceptions\n",
    "3. **Seamless Integration**: No additional decorators or code changes required\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.func import task\n",
    "\n",
    "@task  # This is automatically detected and instrumented by TruGraph\n",
    "def my_agent_function(state, config):\n",
    "    # Your agent logic here\n",
    "    return updated_state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The instrumentation happens automatically when you create a TruGraph instance - no manual setup required!\n"

    "### 🎯 Key Benefits of Custom Class Support\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Automatic Detection:**\n",
    "- TruGraph automatically finds LangGraph components within your custom classes\n",
    "- No need to manually specify what to instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Flexible Method Selection:**\n",
    "- Auto-detects common methods like `run()`, `invoke()`, `execute()`, `call()`, `__call__()`\n",
    "- Or explicitly specify: `TruGraph(app, main_method=app.custom_method)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Comprehensive Tracing:**\n",
    "- Instruments both your custom orchestration logic AND internal LangGraph workflows\n",
    "- Captures the full execution flow across multiple LangGraph invocations\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Multi-Workflow Support:**\n",
    "- Perfect for complex agents with planning → retrieval → synthesis patterns\n",
    "- Handles parallel workflow execution\n",
    "- Maintains trace relationships across workflow boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Business Logic Integration:**\n",
    "- Your custom preprocessing/postprocessing steps are included in traces\n",
    "- Evaluate end-to-end performance, not just individual LangGraph components\n",
    "- Better insights into real-world application behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Patterns:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Simple case - auto-detect everything\n",
    "tru_app = TruGraph(my_custom_agent)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Explicit main method\n",
    "tru_app = TruGraph(my_custom_agent, main_method=my_custom_agent.process)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple methods instrumented separately\n",
    "tru_fast = TruGraph(agent, main_method=agent.quick_mode, app_version=\"fast\")\n",
    "tru_full = TruGraph(agent, main_method=agent.full_mode, app_version=\"comprehensive\")\n",
