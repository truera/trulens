    "   - If it says gaps are minor or non‑blocking, proceed without replanning.\n",

    "4. If the score is < 0.5 **or** the explanation clearly indicates missing/irrelevant data, you may set `\"replan\": true`—unless the missing info is already scheduled to be produced by later steps.\n",
    "5. Do **not** replan solely to add redundant verification.\n",
    "6. If this step has been replanned {attempts}/{max_replans} times already, avoid another replan unless the explanation shows a critical blocker that cannot be bypassed.\n",
