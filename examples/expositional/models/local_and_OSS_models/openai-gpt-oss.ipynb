    "# OpenAI OSS Models as Judge with TruLens\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is a key component for using TruLens, useful for assessing the quality of AI apps and increasingly AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presents a competing set of requirements for many developers looking to build and assess the quality of agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need powerful, reliable LLMs to assess the performance of increasingly complex tasks.\n",
    "2. The models used for evaluation should not be cost prohibitive (as the token requirements are large).\n",
    "3. In many situations, the models themselves need to be runnable on local hardware (rather than via an API)\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet these requirements, we often have to choose between large, proprietary models and smaller, open ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's release of GPT-OSS models (20B and 120B) are an important advancement to adress these competing requirements offering highly performant reasoning at a competitive price, runnable on local hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "TruLens offers day-0 support of these models, allowing you to evaluate your AI agents with powerful OSS models like the GPT-OSS series.\n",
