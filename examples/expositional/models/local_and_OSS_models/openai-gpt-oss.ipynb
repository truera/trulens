    "# OpenAI OSS Models as Judge with TruLens\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is a key component for using TruLens, useful for assessing the quality of AI apps and increasingly complex AI agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "As agents become more sophisticated, developers face competing requirements when choosing evaluation models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Powerful, reliable LLMs capable of assessing complex tasks.\n",
    "2. Models used for evaluation should be cost-effective (despite large token requirements).\n",
    "3. Models should be runnable on local hardware/deployment (rather than locked via API access).\n",
    "\n",
    "To meet these requirements, we often have to choose between expensive, large, proprietary models and smaller open-source ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's release of [GPT-OSS models (20B and 120B)](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/) are an important advancement in address these competing requirements, offering highly performant, open-weight reasoning language models at competitive costs, while supporting local deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "TruLens provides day-0 support for these models, enabling you to evaluate your AI agents with powerful OSS models like the GPT-OSS series.\n",
