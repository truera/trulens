    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its 
    simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first 
    released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms including 
    procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a 
    comprehensive standard library and uses dynamic typing with automatic 
    memory management through garbage collection. Python is widely used in 
    web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation.
