It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples. If a user asks for a value not in the list (e.g., \\\"Canada\\\"), assume it exists and use the value from their question in your query.\\n* Retrieved Literals (searched live): This is a complete, live-searched list of all possible values. You must only use a value from this list. If the user's input has a typo or different casing (e.g., \\\"michele\\\" vs. the retrieved \\\"Michelle\\\"), use the closest match from the retrieved list. Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\"]\n",

They are often descriptive attributes that can be used to slice and dice data for analysis (eg. used in group-by clause). Example of dimensions include geography (e.g., country, state, city), or other business-specific criteria (e.g., product categories, customer segments). Time dimension is a special dimension indicative of time axis (e.g., year, month, date).\\\\nMeasures are the quantitative data that can be aggregated, summed, averaged, counted, etc., for analysis. They are typically numeric fields.\\\\n\\\\nThink step by step and use the following instructions while generating SQL:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1. Identify the metric calculation needed. Metric are typically calculations upon measures. If no specific aggregation mentioned in the question for measure calculations, please use the default aggregation indicated in the column comment.\\\\n\\\\n2. Identify the slicing and dicing needed. Those are used in group-bys in SQL.\\\\n\\\\n3. Identify if any filtering's needed. Filtering may be done on certain metric, if so, think back to the metric calculation step.\\\\n\\\\n4. When create table or column alias, please avoid any snowflake SQL keywords as it will cause execution failure, eg. to.\\\\n\\\\n5. Please DO NOT *100 for ratio or percentage calculation. Keep the number as decimals. However, if any instructions below contradict this instruction, please ignore this instruction.\\\\n\\\\n6. For questions requiring time aggregation on different frequency than provided, please use DATE_TRUNC() to convert the frequency and aggregate measure properly by including the frequency in a group by. If you need to compare time to a NUMBER type column, use DATE_PART() to extract the year or month or date number from a timestamp. If asking on day of a week, use DAYOFWEEK() function to get the day number.\\\\n\\\\n7. If the question is asking metric on a time series data of specific month without referring to year, please assume current year and convert the question to specific month/year.\\\\n        Current date is 2025-10-04.\\\\n        Eg. give me the total sales for March. -> give me the total sales for 2025 March.\\\\n\\\\n8. For questions on time series data asking DoD, MoM, YoY calculations, always include the figures for both the current period and the preceding period in the result to help validation.\\\\n        If not specified in user question, always calculate both absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n        DO NOT use LEAD() or LAG() function to obtain previous period values, as these functions assume consecutive time data, which might not always be true.\\\\n        Instead, use CTE or subqueries to explicitly match the corresponding periods. For example, to calculate DoD change:\\\\n        select\\\\n            curr.date as curr_date,\\\\n            prev.date as prev_date,\\\\n            curr.value as curr_value,\\\\n            prev.value as prev_value,\\\\n            curr_value - prev_value as dod_chg,\\\\n            case when prev_value <> 0 then (curr_value - prev_value)/prev_value end as dod_pct_chg\\\\n            from daily_table as curr\\\\n            left join daily_table as prev\\\\n            on (curr.date = prev.date + interval'1 day');\\\\n\\\\n9. For questions asking consecutive trend on time series data, please try below:\\\\n        (1) create a CTE that calculates the absolute change of relevant time frequency. Mark as 1 as a trend match flag for the days where absolute change matches the trend asked in question.\\\\n        (2) create another CTE where sum of the trend match flags qualify the number of days within the question, and get the start and end time window.\\\\n        (3) Join back to the original time series data to filter out the qualified time window.\\\\n        Please DO NOT use LEAD() or LAG() function to obtain previous period values, as these functions assume consecutive time data, which might not always be true.\\\\n\\\\n        eg. question: did any product show consecutive increases in revenue for 5 or more days:\\\\n        WITH dod_increase AS (\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                curr.date,\\\\n                curr.product,\\\\n                curr.revenue,\\\\n                CASE WHEN (curr.revenue - prev.revenue) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_increasing\\\\n            FROM daily_product_revenue AS curr\\\\n                LEFT JOIN daily_product_revenue AS prev\\\\n                ON (curr.date = prev.date + interval'1 day' AND curr.product = prev.product)\\\\n        ), dates_of_increase AS (\\\\n            SELECT product,\\\\n                -- start window is 5 day prior as question when asking on \\\\\\\"5 or more days\\\\\\\".\\\\n                dateadd(day, -5, date) AS window_start,\\\\n                date AS window_end\\\\n            FROM dod_increase\\\\n                -- check the total increase (between 4 preceding and current) is 5.\\\\n                QUALIFY SUM(is_increasing) over (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date rows between 4 preceding AND current row) = 5\\\\n        )\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            DISTINCT dod_increase.product, date, revenue\\\\n        FROM dod_increase\\\\n        JOIN dates_of_increase ON\\\\n            dod_increase.product_line = dates_of_increase.product_line\\\\n            AND dod_increase.date between dates_of_increase.window_start AND dates_of_increase.window_end\\\\n        ORDER BY date DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n10. For questions on time series data asking DoD, MoM, YoY calculations, always include the current time period, preceding time period, current period value and the preceding period value in the output columns.\\\\n        (a) If not specified in user question, always calculate both absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n        (b) DO NOT use LEAD() or LAG() function to obtain previous period values, as these functions assume consecutive time data, which might not always be true.\\\\n            Instead, use CTE or subqueries to explicitly match the corresponding periods. For example, to calculate DoD change:\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            -- output current period, prev period, current value, prev value, absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n            curr.date AS curr_date,\\\\n            prev.date AS prev_date,\\\\n            curr.value AS curr_value,\\\\n            prev.value AS prev_value,\\\\n            curr_value - prev_value AS dod_chg,\\\\n            (curr_value - prev_value)/NULLIF(prev_value, 0) AS dod_pct_chg\\\\n            FROM daily_table AS curr\\\\n            LEFT JOIN daily_table AS prev\\\\n            ON (curr.date = prev.date + interval'1 day')\\\\n            ORDER BY curr_date DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n        When asking week-over-week, month-over-month, or year-over-year of a certain period, you should calculate the week over week changes first, and then filter the time period. Example of week-over-week changes after 2023 Sep:\\\\n        WITH weekly_table AS(\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                DATE_TRUNC('WEEK', date) AS week,\\\\n                count(date) as num_days,\\\\n                SUM(daily_revenue) AS weekly_revenue,\\\\n            FROM daily_table\\\\n            GROUP BY date_trunc('WEEK', date)\\\\n        ),\\\\n        wow AS (\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            -- output current period, prev period, current value, prev value, absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n            curr.week AS curr_week,\\\\n            curr.num_days as curr_num_days,\\\\n            prev.week AS prev_week,\\\\n            curr.weekly_revenue AS curr_weekly_revenue,\\\\n            prev.weekly_revenue AS prev_weekly_revenue,\\\\n            curr_weekly_revenue - prev_weekly_revenue AS wow_chg,\\\\n            (curr_weekly_revenue - prev_weekly_revenue)/NULLIF(prev_weekly_revenue, 0) AS wow_pct_chg\\\\n            FROM weekly_table AS curr\\\\n            LEFT JOIN weekly_table AS prev\\\\n            ON (curr.week = prev.week + interval'1 week')\\\\n            ORDER BY curr_week DESC NULLS LAST\\\\n        )\\\\n        select * from wow where curr_week >= '2023-09-01';\\\\n\\\\n11. For questions asking rolling window metrics on a timeseries, please always:\\\\n        (1) OPTIONAL - aggregate data by day or specified time granularity if the time dimension you are using is not part of the primary key or has duplicate values (does not contain `unique values: true`).\\\\n        (2) create a CTE that compute the rolling metrics\\\\n        (3) filter down to the appropriate time period asked in question.\\\\n        (The metric at the beginning or end of the time window might be incorrect if you first filter the time and then calculate rolling metrics).\\\\n        eg. question: What is the 3-day rolling average of sales for year 2023.\\\\n        ```sql\\\\n        WITH daily_sales AS (\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                date,\\\\n                -- Aggregate data when dimension is not primary key, has duplicate values or is converted to a date part\\\\n                SUM(SALES) AS daily_sales\\\\n            FROM table\\\\n            GROUP BY date\\\\n        ),\\\\n        rolling_avg AS (\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                date,\\\\n                -- Calculate the rolling metrics.\\\\n                AVG(daily_sales) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_3d\\\\n            FROM daily_sales\\\\n        )\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            date,\\\\n            rolling_avg_3d\\\\n        FROM rolling_avg\\\\n        -- Then, filter down to the asked time period.\\\\n        WHERE DATE_PART('YEAR', date) = '2023'\\\\n        ORDER BY date DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n        ```\\\\n\\\\n        So, remember: ensure correct daily or time-specific aggregation, calculate, then filter!\\\\n\\\\n12. If the question is asking metric on a time series data without any time range, please assume the question asks for the entire available time period in data.\\\\n        Eg. Give me net sales by customer. -> Give me net sales by customer over the entire available time period.\\\\n        When writing your SQL query, include columns for the start date and end date to show the time range of the data used. Eg.\\\\n        'select customer, min(date) as start_date, max(date) as end_date, sum(net_sales) from table;'\\\\n        Ensure that you calculate the start date and end date from the same table or CTE used in your main query, without introducing additional joins that could cause data fan-out or incorrect aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n13. For questions that asks about 'top k', 'lowest', 'highest', you should first check if question requires ranking across partitions or not.\\\\n        Eg. Give me the top 5 client by sales for current month. This question does not require ranking across partitions, and can be solved by simple filtering + order by:\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                customer_name, SUM(daily_sales) AS current_month_sales\\\\n            FROM daily_sales\\\\n            WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', date) = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)\\\\n            GROUP BY customer_name\\\\n            ORDER BY current_month_sales DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 5;\\\\n\\\\n        However, if question asks ranking within each partitions, or explicitly requests a rank column, you should use a window function to create the rank first.\\\\n        Eg. Give me the top 5 client by sales for each month:\\\\n            WITH monthly_sales as(\\\\n                SELECT\\\\n                    customer_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', date) AS month, SUM(daily_sales) AS month_sales\\\\n                FROM daily_sales\\\\n                GROUP BY customer_name, month\\\\n            ), monthly_sales_with_rank AS (\\\\n                SELECT\\\\n                    customer_name, month_sales, rank() OVER (partition by month ORDER BY month_sales DESC NULLS LAST) AS rnk\\\\n                FROM monthly_sales)\\\\n            SELECT * FROM monthly_sales_with_rank WHERE rnk <=5 ORDER BY month DESC, rnk NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n14. When asking about highest or lowest metric (number, ratio, etc.) that requires sorting, please always include NULLS LAST in your order by clause. eg. SELECT name, ratio FROM ratio_table ORDER BY ratio DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n15. If working with timeseries and no specific sorting mentioned in the question, always by default sort time descending to show the latest information at top.\\\\n\\\\n16. In single table queries without joins, when counting the number of unique values in a dimension column that has duplicate values (i.e., does not contain `unique values: true`), use `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`. If the dimension column has `unique values: true`, meaning it contains unique values like a primary key, use `COUNT(column)` without `DISTINCT`.\\\\n\\\\n17. The primary key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row and defines data granularity. When calculating measures on different data granularity than the primary key, always use `GROUP BY` to ensure correct aggregation. Use `PARTITION BY` for window functions as needed.\\\\n\\\\n18. If the user's question requires filtering over a long time range:\\\\n        a. If the user uses a unit of time longer than a day (like week, month, year), ALWAYS assume the user means the calendar unit (e.g., calendar week/month/year).\\\\n        Push the date computation into the SQL query; do NOT use your knowledge of the current date, that should be computed at SQL query execution time.\\\\n        As concrete examples:\\\\n        - \\\\\\\"last week\\\\\\\":\\\\n                - filter should be: DATE >= DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 week') AND DATE < DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE)\\\\n        - \\\\\\\"this month\\\\\\\":\\\\n                - filter should be: DATE >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)\\\\n        b. If the user asks \\\\\\\"in the past X days\\\\\\\", then use DATE >= DATEADD(day, -X, CURRENT_DATE).\\\\n\\\\n19. In the section 'example literals and retrieved literals', you are provided with two types of column values:\\\\na. 'example literals, NOT searched live': These values are ONLY EXAMPLES to illustrate the data format and type of values in the column. The list is NOT EXHAUSTIVE and represents just a small sample of possible values. You should assume that any reasonable value mentioned in the user question likely exists in the table, even if it's not listed in the examples. These examples are provided solely to help you understand the data pattern and format.\\\\nIMPORTANT: When you see 'example literals, NOT searched live', treat the user's requested values as valid and likely to exist in the database, and feel free to infer reasonable values to use based on your knowledge, regardless of whether they appear in the example list.\\\\nb. 'retrieved literals, searched live': These values are retrieved directly from the table based on the user question and represent ALL possible matches for the specific search. The search index will retrieve values even if the user question has minor typos or is the wrong case. For these columns, you MUST ONLY use one or more of the retrieved values in your filters - NEVER use values inferred from the question that are not in the retrieved list.\\\\nIMPORTANT: When a user mentions a name or value that doesn't exactly match the retrieved literals, you must find the closest match from the retrieved literals and use that instead. For example:\\\\n- If the user asks for 'michele pena' but the retrieved literals contain 'Michelle Pena', use 'Michelle Pena'\\\\n- If the user asks for 'Viktor Butler' but retrieved literals show 'Victor Butler', use 'Victor Butler'\\\\n- If no reasonable match exists in the retrieved literals, the query will return no results\\\\nAlways prioritize retrieved literals over the user's exact spelling/casing. The retrieved literals represent the actual data in the table.\\\\n\\\\n20. Please use joins in the supported join paths only. Do not switch the left and right tables in the join clause.\\\\n\\\\n21. When you are joining more than one tables, please assign reasonable alias to each table and make sure to ALWAYS qualify your column with the table alias in all clauses.\\\\nThis helps to avoid ambiguity in the SQL compiler and improve readability of the SQL query.\\\\n\\\\n22. Please avoid having joins in subqueries, and write it as CTE instead. Be mindful of fan-trap or chasm-trap when joining more than two tables together.\\\\n\\\\n23. Be mindful of data granularity and relationships between tables. When joining tables with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, consider how this affects data duplication, especially during aggregations like averages, sums, or counts.\\\\n\\\\n24. Always be aware of primary keys and data granularity when joining tables. Aggregate data at the appropriate level, grouping by necessary columns to maintain correct data granularity.\\\\n\\\\n25. Extract unique records when necessary. If a parent record appears multiple times due to joins (e.g., a customer with multiple orders), and you need to perform calculations on unique parent records, extract distinct parent-level information before performing the calculation.\\\\n                Incorrect Example:\\\\n\\\\n                    SELECT\\\\n                        r.region,\\\\n                        AVG(c.income) AS average_income\\\\n                    FROM orders o\\\\n                    LEFT OUTER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id\\\\n                    LEFT OUTER JOIN regions r ON o.region_id = r.region_id\\\\n                    GROUP BY r.region;\\\\n\\\\n                Correct Example:\\\\n\\\\n                    WITH unique_customers AS (\\\\n                        SELECT DISTINCT\\\\n                            c.customer_id,\\\\n                            c.income,\\\\n                            r.region\\\\n                        FROM orders o\\\\n                        LEFT OUTER JOIN customers c c.customer_id = o.customer_id\\\\n                        LEFT OUTER JOIN regions r ON o.region_id = r.region_id\\\\n                    )\\\\n\\\\n                    SELECT\\\\n                        uc.region,\\\\n                        AVG(uc.income) AS average_income\\\\n                    FROM unique_customers uc\\\\n                    GROUP BY uc.region;\\\\n\\\\n                Explanation: The incorrect query joins orders to customers (many-to-one) and orders to regions (many-to-one), resulting in duplicated customer records for each order. This causes double-counting when calculating the average income. The correct query extracts unique customer records before performing the calculation, avoiding this issue.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(Section 2): Semantic model containing DDL statements.\\\\n\\\\nPlease find below the definitions in the semantic model of interest, workday_orgchart_flat (note: the name is metadata, don't prefix table names with it):\\\\nCREATE TABLE __sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain (\\\\n  -- Synonyms: employee id.

The tables are interconnected through employee IDs and names, allowing for complete visibility of the organizational structure from multiple perspectives - both hierarchical and product-based.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nThe Workday Organization Chart Flat semantic model, located in SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.WORKDAY, provides a complete view of the organizational structure, employee relationships, and product ownership hierarchy. It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples. If a user asks for a value not in the list (e.g., \\\"Canada\\\"), assume it exists and use the value from their question in your query.\\n* Retrieved Literals (searched live): This is a complete, live-searched list of all possible values. You must only use a value from this list. If the user's input has a typo or different casing (e.g., \\\"michele\\\" vs. the retrieved \\\"Michelle\\\"), use the closest match from the retrieved list. Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\"]\n",

This seems like a perfect use case for the Workday_Orgchart tool, which contains employee information and reporting structure data.\\n\\nLooking at the tool description, it has tables like:\\n- SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with columns including EMPLOYEE_NAME, MANAGER_NAME, NUM_ACTIVE_REPORTS, NUM_ACTIVE_DIRECT_REPORTS\\n- REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT with hierarchical reporting relationships\\n\\nI need to:\\n1. Find Sridhar Ramaswamy's direct reports\\n2. For each direct report, get their total number of reports\\n\\nThis is a straightforward organizational query that the Workday_Orgchart tool should be able to handle.\\n</thinking>\",\"Assistant: <thinking>\\nPerfect! I have the data I need to answer the question. The SQL query successfully retrieved Sridhar Ramaswamy's direct reports and their total number of reports. Let me analyze the results:\\n\\nThe data shows 10 direct reports of Sridhar Ramaswamy:\\n1. Mike Gannon - 5,142 total reports\\n2. Benoit Dageville - 2,456 total reports  \\n3. Brian Robins - 914 total reports\\n4. Mike Blandina - 572 total reports\\n5. Denise Persson - 494 total reports\\n6. Arnnon Geshuri - 229 total reports\\n7. Derk Lupinek - 99 total reports\\n8. Ann Marie Lavigne - 4 total reports\\n9. Kelly Ikler - 0 total reports\\n10. Mike Scarpelli - 0 total reports\\n\\nThe data quality checks show:\\n- We have complete data for all 10 direct reports (record_count = 1 for each)\\n- The range of total reports varies significantly from 0 to 5,142\\n- The average is 991 total reports across all direct reports\\n\\nThis data looks comprehensive and answers the user's question completely.

The tables are interconnected through employee IDs and names, allowing for complete visibility of the organizational structure from multiple perspectives - both hierarchical and product-based.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nThe Workday Organization Chart Flat semantic model, located in SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.WORKDAY, provides a complete view of the organizational structure, employee relationships, and product ownership hierarchy. It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples. If a user asks for a value not in the list (e.g., \\\"Canada\\\"), assume it exists and use the value from their question in your query.\\n* Retrieved Literals (searched live): This is a complete, live-searched list of all possible values. You must only use a value from this list. If the user's input has a typo or different casing (e.g., \\\"michele\\\" vs. the retrieved \\\"Michelle\\\"), use the closest match from the retrieved list. Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\"]\n",

The tables are interconnected through employee IDs and names, allowing for complete visibility of the organizational structure from multiple perspectives - both hierarchical and product-based.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nThe Workday Organization Chart Flat semantic model, located in SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.WORKDAY, provides a complete view of the organizational structure, employee relationships, and product ownership hierarchy. It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples. If a user asks for a value not in the list (e.g., \\\"Canada\\\"), assume it exists and use the value from their question in your query.\\n* Retrieved Literals (searched live): This is a complete, live-searched list of all possible values. You must only use a value from this list. If the user's input has a typo or different casing (e.g., \\\"michele\\\" vs. the retrieved \\\"Michelle\\\"), use the closest match from the retrieved list. Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\"]\n",

The tables are interconnected through employee IDs and names, allowing for complete visibility of the organizational structure from multiple perspectives - both hierarchical and product-based.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nThe Workday Organization Chart Flat semantic model, located in SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.WORKDAY, provides a complete view of the organizational structure, employee relationships, and product ownership hierarchy. It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples. If a user asks for a value not in the list (e.g., \\\"Canada\\\"), assume it exists and use the value from their question in your query.\\n* Retrieved Literals (searched live): This is a complete, live-searched list of all possible values. You must only use a value from this list. If the user's input has a typo or different casing (e.g., \\\"michele\\\" vs. the retrieved \\\"Michelle\\\"), use the closest match from the retrieved list. Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\"]\n",

They are often descriptive attributes that can be used to slice and dice data for analysis (eg. used in group-by clause). Example of dimensions include geography (e.g., country, state, city), or other business-specific criteria (e.g., product categories, customer segments). Time dimension is a special dimension indicative of time axis (e.g., year, month, date).\\\\nMeasures are the quantitative data that can be aggregated, summed, averaged, counted, etc., for analysis. They are typically numeric fields.\\\\n\\\\nThink step by step and use the following instructions while generating SQL:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1. Identify the metric calculation needed. Metric are typically calculations upon measures. If no specific aggregation mentioned in the question for measure calculations, please use the default aggregation indicated in the column comment.\\\\n\\\\n2. Identify the slicing and dicing needed. Those are used in group-bys in SQL.\\\\n\\\\n3. Identify if any filtering's needed. Filtering may be done on certain metric, if so, think back to the metric calculation step.\\\\n\\\\n4. When create table or column alias, please avoid any snowflake SQL keywords as it will cause execution failure, eg. to.\\\\n\\\\n5. Please DO NOT *100 for ratio or percentage calculation. Keep the number as decimals. However, if any instructions below contradict this instruction, please ignore this instruction.\\\\n\\\\n6. For questions requiring time aggregation on different frequency than provided, please use DATE_TRUNC() to convert the frequency and aggregate measure properly by including the frequency in a group by. If you need to compare time to a NUMBER type column, use DATE_PART() to extract the year or month or date number from a timestamp. If asking on day of a week, use DAYOFWEEK() function to get the day number.\\\\n\\\\n7. If the question is asking metric on a time series data of specific month without referring to year, please assume current year and convert the question to specific month/year.\\\\n        Current date is 2025-10-04.\\\\n        Eg. give me the total sales for March. -> give me the total sales for 2025 March.\\\\n\\\\n8. For questions on time series data asking DoD, MoM, YoY calculations, always include the figures for both the current period and the preceding period in the result to help validation.\\\\n        If not specified in user question, always calculate both absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n        DO NOT use LEAD() or LAG() function to obtain previous period values, as these functions assume consecutive time data, which might not always be true.\\\\n        Instead, use CTE or subqueries to explicitly match the corresponding periods. For example, to calculate DoD change:\\\\n        select\\\\n            curr.date as curr_date,\\\\n            prev.date as prev_date,\\\\n            curr.value as curr_value,\\\\n            prev.value as prev_value,\\\\n            curr_value - prev_value as dod_chg,\\\\n            case when prev_value <> 0 then (curr_value - prev_value)/prev_value end as dod_pct_chg\\\\n            from daily_table as curr\\\\n            left join daily_table as prev\\\\n            on (curr.date = prev.date + interval'1 day');\\\\n\\\\n9. For questions asking consecutive trend on time series data, please try below:\\\\n        (1) create a CTE that calculates the absolute change of relevant time frequency. Mark as 1 as a trend match flag for the days where absolute change matches the trend asked in question.\\\\n        (2) create another CTE where sum of the trend match flags qualify the number of days within the question, and get the start and end time window.\\\\n        (3) Join back to the original time series data to filter out the qualified time window.\\\\n        Please DO NOT use LEAD() or LAG() function to obtain previous period values, as these functions assume consecutive time data, which might not always be true.\\\\n\\\\n        eg. question: did any product show consecutive increases in revenue for 5 or more days:\\\\n        WITH dod_increase AS (\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                curr.date,\\\\n                curr.product,\\\\n                curr.revenue,\\\\n                CASE WHEN (curr.revenue - prev.revenue) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_increasing\\\\n            FROM daily_product_revenue AS curr\\\\n                LEFT JOIN daily_product_revenue AS prev\\\\n                ON (curr.date = prev.date + interval'1 day' AND curr.product = prev.product)\\\\n        ), dates_of_increase AS (\\\\n            SELECT product,\\\\n                -- start window is 5 day prior as question when asking on \\\\\\\"5 or more days\\\\\\\".\\\\n                dateadd(day, -5, date) AS window_start,\\\\n                date AS window_end\\\\n            FROM dod_increase\\\\n                -- check the total increase (between 4 preceding and current) is 5.\\\\n                QUALIFY SUM(is_increasing) over (PARTITION BY product ORDER BY date rows between 4 preceding AND current row) = 5\\\\n        )\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            DISTINCT dod_increase.product, date, revenue\\\\n        FROM dod_increase\\\\n        JOIN dates_of_increase ON\\\\n            dod_increase.product_line = dates_of_increase.product_line\\\\n            AND dod_increase.date between dates_of_increase.window_start AND dates_of_increase.window_end\\\\n        ORDER BY date DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n10. For questions on time series data asking DoD, MoM, YoY calculations, always include the current time period, preceding time period, current period value and the preceding period value in the output columns.\\\\n        (a) If not specified in user question, always calculate both absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n        (b) DO NOT use LEAD() or LAG() function to obtain previous period values, as these functions assume consecutive time data, which might not always be true.\\\\n            Instead, use CTE or subqueries to explicitly match the corresponding periods. For example, to calculate DoD change:\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            -- output current period, prev period, current value, prev value, absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n            curr.date AS curr_date,\\\\n            prev.date AS prev_date,\\\\n            curr.value AS curr_value,\\\\n            prev.value AS prev_value,\\\\n            curr_value - prev_value AS dod_chg,\\\\n            (curr_value - prev_value)/NULLIF(prev_value, 0) AS dod_pct_chg\\\\n            FROM daily_table AS curr\\\\n            LEFT JOIN daily_table AS prev\\\\n            ON (curr.date = prev.date + interval'1 day')\\\\n            ORDER BY curr_date DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n        When asking week-over-week, month-over-month, or year-over-year of a certain period, you should calculate the week over week changes first, and then filter the time period. Example of week-over-week changes after 2023 Sep:\\\\n        WITH weekly_table AS(\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                DATE_TRUNC('WEEK', date) AS week,\\\\n                count(date) as num_days,\\\\n                SUM(daily_revenue) AS weekly_revenue,\\\\n            FROM daily_table\\\\n            GROUP BY date_trunc('WEEK', date)\\\\n        ),\\\\n        wow AS (\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            -- output current period, prev period, current value, prev value, absolute change and percentage change.\\\\n            curr.week AS curr_week,\\\\n            curr.num_days as curr_num_days,\\\\n            prev.week AS prev_week,\\\\n            curr.weekly_revenue AS curr_weekly_revenue,\\\\n            prev.weekly_revenue AS prev_weekly_revenue,\\\\n            curr_weekly_revenue - prev_weekly_revenue AS wow_chg,\\\\n            (curr_weekly_revenue - prev_weekly_revenue)/NULLIF(prev_weekly_revenue, 0) AS wow_pct_chg\\\\n            FROM weekly_table AS curr\\\\n            LEFT JOIN weekly_table AS prev\\\\n            ON (curr.week = prev.week + interval'1 week')\\\\n            ORDER BY curr_week DESC NULLS LAST\\\\n        )\\\\n        select * from wow where curr_week >= '2023-09-01';\\\\n\\\\n11. For questions asking rolling window metrics on a timeseries, please always:\\\\n        (1) OPTIONAL - aggregate data by day or specified time granularity if the time dimension you are using is not part of the primary key or has duplicate values (does not contain `unique values: true`).\\\\n        (2) create a CTE that compute the rolling metrics\\\\n        (3) filter down to the appropriate time period asked in question.\\\\n        (The metric at the beginning or end of the time window might be incorrect if you first filter the time and then calculate rolling metrics).\\\\n        eg. question: What is the 3-day rolling average of sales for year 2023.\\\\n        ```sql\\\\n        WITH daily_sales AS (\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                date,\\\\n                -- Aggregate data when dimension is not primary key, has duplicate values or is converted to a date part\\\\n                SUM(SALES) AS daily_sales\\\\n            FROM table\\\\n            GROUP BY date\\\\n        ),\\\\n        rolling_avg AS (\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                date,\\\\n                -- Calculate the rolling metrics.\\\\n                AVG(daily_sales) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_avg_3d\\\\n            FROM daily_sales\\\\n        )\\\\n        SELECT\\\\n            date,\\\\n            rolling_avg_3d\\\\n        FROM rolling_avg\\\\n        -- Then, filter down to the asked time period.\\\\n        WHERE DATE_PART('YEAR', date) = '2023'\\\\n        ORDER BY date DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n        ```\\\\n\\\\n        So, remember: ensure correct daily or time-specific aggregation, calculate, then filter!\\\\n\\\\n12. If the question is asking metric on a time series data without any time range, please assume the question asks for the entire available time period in data.\\\\n        Eg. Give me net sales by customer. -> Give me net sales by customer over the entire available time period.\\\\n        When writing your SQL query, include columns for the start date and end date to show the time range of the data used. Eg.\\\\n        'select customer, min(date) as start_date, max(date) as end_date, sum(net_sales) from table;'\\\\n        Ensure that you calculate the start date and end date from the same table or CTE used in your main query, without introducing additional joins that could cause data fan-out or incorrect aggregations.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n13. For questions that asks about 'top k', 'lowest', 'highest', you should first check if question requires ranking across partitions or not.\\\\n        Eg. Give me the top 5 client by sales for current month. This question does not require ranking across partitions, and can be solved by simple filtering + order by:\\\\n            SELECT\\\\n                customer_name, SUM(daily_sales) AS current_month_sales\\\\n            FROM daily_sales\\\\n            WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', date) = DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)\\\\n            GROUP BY customer_name\\\\n            ORDER BY current_month_sales DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 5;\\\\n\\\\n        However, if question asks ranking within each partitions, or explicitly requests a rank column, you should use a window function to create the rank first.\\\\n        Eg. Give me the top 5 client by sales for each month:\\\\n            WITH monthly_sales as(\\\\n                SELECT\\\\n                    customer_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', date) AS month, SUM(daily_sales) AS month_sales\\\\n                FROM daily_sales\\\\n                GROUP BY customer_name, month\\\\n            ), monthly_sales_with_rank AS (\\\\n                SELECT\\\\n                    customer_name, month_sales, rank() OVER (partition by month ORDER BY month_sales DESC NULLS LAST) AS rnk\\\\n                FROM monthly_sales)\\\\n            SELECT * FROM monthly_sales_with_rank WHERE rnk <=5 ORDER BY month DESC, rnk NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n14. When asking about highest or lowest metric (number, ratio, etc.) that requires sorting, please always include NULLS LAST in your order by clause. eg. SELECT name, ratio FROM ratio_table ORDER BY ratio DESC NULLS LAST;\\\\n\\\\n15. If working with timeseries and no specific sorting mentioned in the question, always by default sort time descending to show the latest information at top.\\\\n\\\\n16. In single table queries without joins, when counting the number of unique values in a dimension column that has duplicate values (i.e., does not contain `unique values: true`), use `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`. If the dimension column has `unique values: true`, meaning it contains unique values like a primary key, use `COUNT(column)` without `DISTINCT`.\\\\n\\\\n17. The primary key is a column (or set of columns) in a table that uniquely identifies each row and defines data granularity. When calculating measures on different data granularity than the primary key, always use `GROUP BY` to ensure correct aggregation. Use `PARTITION BY` for window functions as needed.\\\\n\\\\n18. If the user's question requires filtering over a long time range:\\\\n        a. If the user uses a unit of time longer than a day (like week, month, year), ALWAYS assume the user means the calendar unit (e.g., calendar week/month/year).\\\\n        Push the date computation into the SQL query; do NOT use your knowledge of the current date, that should be computed at SQL query execution time.\\\\n        As concrete examples:\\\\n        - \\\\\\\"last week\\\\\\\":\\\\n                - filter should be: DATE >= DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 week') AND DATE < DATE_TRUNC('week', CURRENT_DATE)\\\\n        - \\\\\\\"this month\\\\\\\":\\\\n                - filter should be: DATE >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)\\\\n        b. If the user asks \\\\\\\"in the past X days\\\\\\\", then use DATE >= DATEADD(day, -X, CURRENT_DATE).\\\\n\\\\n19. In the section 'example literals and retrieved literals', you are provided with two types of column values:\\\\na. 'example literals, NOT searched live': These values are ONLY EXAMPLES to illustrate the data format and type of values in the column. The list is NOT EXHAUSTIVE and represents just a small sample of possible values. You should assume that any reasonable value mentioned in the user question likely exists in the table, even if it's not listed in the examples. These examples are provided solely to help you understand the data pattern and format.\\\\nIMPORTANT: When you see 'example literals, NOT searched live', treat the user's requested values as valid and likely to exist in the database, and feel free to infer reasonable values to use based on your knowledge, regardless of whether they appear in the example list.\\\\nb. 'retrieved literals, searched live': These values are retrieved directly from the table based on the user question and represent ALL possible matches for the specific search. The search index will retrieve values even if the user question has minor typos or is the wrong case. For these columns, you MUST ONLY use one or more of the retrieved values in your filters - NEVER use values inferred from the question that are not in the retrieved list.\\\\nIMPORTANT: When a user mentions a name or value that doesn't exactly match the retrieved literals, you must find the closest match from the retrieved literals and use that instead. For example:\\\\n- If the user asks for 'michele pena' but the retrieved literals contain 'Michelle Pena', use 'Michelle Pena'\\\\n- If the user asks for 'Viktor Butler' but retrieved literals show 'Victor Butler', use 'Victor Butler'\\\\n- If no reasonable match exists in the retrieved literals, the query will return no results\\\\nAlways prioritize retrieved literals over the user's exact spelling/casing. The retrieved literals represent the actual data in the table.\\\\n\\\\n20. Please use joins in the supported join paths only. Do not switch the left and right tables in the join clause.\\\\n\\\\n21. When you are joining more than one tables, please assign reasonable alias to each table and make sure to ALWAYS qualify your column with the table alias in all clauses.\\\\nThis helps to avoid ambiguity in the SQL compiler and improve readability of the SQL query.\\\\n\\\\n22. Please avoid having joins in subqueries, and write it as CTE instead. Be mindful of fan-trap or chasm-trap when joining more than two tables together.\\\\n\\\\n23. Be mindful of data granularity and relationships between tables. When joining tables with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, consider how this affects data duplication, especially during aggregations like averages, sums, or counts.\\\\n\\\\n24. Always be aware of primary keys and data granularity when joining tables. Aggregate data at the appropriate level, grouping by necessary columns to maintain correct data granularity.\\\\n\\\\n25. Extract unique records when necessary. If a parent record appears multiple times due to joins (e.g., a customer with multiple orders), and you need to perform calculations on unique parent records, extract distinct parent-level information before performing the calculation.\\\\n                Incorrect Example:\\\\n\\\\n                    SELECT\\\\n                        r.region,\\\\n                        AVG(c.income) AS average_income\\\\n                    FROM orders o\\\\n                    LEFT OUTER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id\\\\n                    LEFT OUTER JOIN regions r ON o.region_id = r.region_id\\\\n                    GROUP BY r.region;\\\\n\\\\n                Correct Example:\\\\n\\\\n                    WITH unique_customers AS (\\\\n                        SELECT DISTINCT\\\\n                            c.customer_id,\\\\n                            c.income,\\\\n                            r.region\\\\n                        FROM orders o\\\\n                        LEFT OUTER JOIN customers c c.customer_id = o.customer_id\\\\n                        LEFT OUTER JOIN regions r ON o.region_id = r.region_id\\\\n                    )\\\\n\\\\n                    SELECT\\\\n                        uc.region,\\\\n                        AVG(uc.income) AS average_income\\\\n                    FROM unique_customers uc\\\\n                    GROUP BY uc.region;\\\\n\\\\n                Explanation: The incorrect query joins orders to customers (many-to-one) and orders to regions (many-to-one), resulting in duplicated customer records for each order. This causes double-counting when calculating the average income. The correct query extracts unique customer records before performing the calculation, avoiding this issue.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(Section 2): Semantic model containing DDL statements.\\\\n\\\\nPlease find below the definitions in the semantic model of interest, workday_orgchart_flat (note: the name is metadata, don't prefix table names with it):\\\\nCREATE TABLE __sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain (\\\\n  -- Synonyms: employee id.

Original user question: Who are the direct reports of Sridhar Ramaswamy and how many total reports does each of them have? Use additional columns to check missing data: include COUNT(*) to verify we have complete data for all of Sridhar Ramaswamy's direct reports Use additional columns to understand data distribution: include MIN(NUM_ACTIVE_REPORTS), MAX(NUM_ACTIVE_REPORTS), AVG(NUM_ACTIVE_REPORTS) to check the distribution of total reports across Sridhar's direct reports\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nYour task is to:\\\\n\\\\n1. Analyze if the question in (section 4) can be answered using the existing columns or suggested metric calculations in (section 2).\\\\n2. Check if the question in (section 4) has any ambiguity that needs clarification, such as unclear terms, multiple interpretations of the question, or potential match to multiple retrieved literals.\\\\n3. Generate appropriate SQL query to the question in (section 4) if possible, using the instructions in (section 1) and the example SQLs in (section 3).

The tables are interconnected through employee IDs and names, allowing for complete visibility of the organizational structure from multiple perspectives - both hierarchical and product-based.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nThe Workday Organization Chart Flat semantic model, located in SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.WORKDAY, provides a complete view of the organizational structure, employee relationships, and product ownership hierarchy. It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples. If a user asks for a value not in the list (e.g., \\\"Canada\\\"), assume it exists and use the value from their question in your query.\\n* Retrieved Literals (searched live): This is a complete, live-searched list of all possible values. You must only use a value from this list. If the user's input has a typo or different casing (e.g., \\\"michele\\\" vs. the retrieved \\\"Michelle\\\"), use the closest match from the retrieved list. Use the following provided verified queries to interpret the user question and generated SQL:  - Question: which current employee has the longest reporting chain?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT employee_name, org_level FROM reporting_chain_flat WHERE is_active = TRUE ORDER BY org_level DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1\\n - Question: what are the names, titles, emails, and org level of everyone reporting into Jeff Hollan?\\n\\n   SQL: SELECT wdu.employee_name, wdu.business_title, wdu.primary_work_email, rcf.org_level FROM snowflake_intelligence.workday.reporting_chain_flat rcf join snowflake_intelligence.workday.sfdc_workday_user_with_reporting_chain wdu on rcf.employee_id = wdu.employee_id where org_level_up_name = 'Jeff Hollan' and rcf.is_active = TRUE;\\n\"]\n",

The tables are interconnected through employee IDs and names, allowing for complete visibility of the organizational structure from multiple perspectives - both hierarchical and product-based.\\n\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nThe Workday Organization Chart Flat semantic model, located in SNOWFLAKE_INTELLIGENCE.WORKDAY, provides a complete view of the organizational structure, employee relationships, and product ownership hierarchy. It combines employee details from SFDC_WORKDAY_USER_WITH_REPORTING_CHAIN with hierarchical reporting relationships from REPORTING_CHAIN_FLAT, while PRODUCT_OWNERS adds product management structure information. The model enables analysis of reporting chains, team structures, and product ownership across different management levels, with multiple relationships between tables based on employee identifiers and names. This model is particularly useful for understanding organizational hierarchy, product ownership, and management chains within the company.. If you have a previous tool result of type cortex_analyst_text_to_sql in the history that is closely related to the current query, you can use the previous_related_tool_result_id parameter to pass it in so that the tool can use it to generate an accurate response.Cortex Analyst itself is an agent that can handle questions based on the rules specified below, so keep the capabilities of the analyst tool in mind when asking a query to analyst. Try to maximize the use of analyst based on its abilities and break questions down when you think it cannot handle the question entirely given the instructions or the tool returns an invalid SQL that does not match your expectations.\\nThe rules below are what the Cortex Analyst tool uses to generate SQL queries.\\n## Core Query Construction\\n* Identify Key Elements: Start by determining the required metrics, dimensions for the GROUP BY clause, and any filters for the WHERE clause.\\n* Use Default Aggregations: If a user doesn't specify an aggregation for a measure (like SUM, AVG), use the default aggregation noted in the column's comments.\\n* Count Correctly: When counting unique items in a column that may have duplicates, always use COUNT(DISTINCT column_name).\\n---\\n## Time Series Analysis\\n* Period-over-Period (DoD, MoM, YoY):\\n    * Do not use LAG() or LEAD(). Instead, use a self-join with a CTE or subquery to compare the current period to the previous one (e.g., ON curr.date = prev.date + interval '1 day').\\n    * Always include columns for both periods (e.g., current_week, previous_week), their values, the absolute change, and the percentage change.\\n* Rolling Windows (e.g., 7-day average):\\n    1.  First, aggregate your data to the correct time granularity (e.g., daily sums) in a CTE.\\n    2.  Next, use a window function to calculate the rolling metric (e.g., AVG(...) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)).\\n    3.  Finally, apply any date filters to the final result.\\n* Consecutive Trends (e.g., 5+ days of growth):\\n    1.  Create a CTE that calculates the period-over-period change and uses a CASE statement to flag if the trend occurred (e.g., 1 for an increase, 0 otherwise).\\n    2.  Use a window function like SUM(...) over the flag in another CTE to identify consecutive streaks.\\n    3.  Join the results back to the original data to show the data for the identified periods.\\n* Time Filtering & Defaults:\\n    * For relative timeframes like \\\"last week\\\" or \\\"this month,\\\" use CURRENT_DATE and functions like DATE_TRUNC in the SQL query.\\n    * If a user asks for a month without a year (e.g., \\\"sales in March\\\"), assume the current year (2025).\\n    * If no time range is specified, query the entire available period and include MIN(date) and MAX(date) as start_date and end_date columns in your output.\\n---\\n## Ranking, Sorting, and General Best Practices\\n* Top K Queries:\\n    * For a simple \\\"top 5,\\\" use ORDER BY ... LIMIT 5.\\n    * For a \\\"top 5 *per group*\\\" (e.g., top 5 products in each region), you must use a RANK() window function with PARTITION BY.\\n* Sorting:\\n    * When sorting by a metric, always use NULLS LAST (e.g., ORDER BY sales DESC NULLS LAST).\\n    * By default, sort time series queries by the time dimension in descending order to show the most recent data first.\\n* Formatting and Aliases:\\n    * Keep ratios and percentages as decimals; do not multiply them by 100.\\n    * Avoid using SQL keywords (like to, end, order) as table or column aliases.\\n---\\n## Handling Text and Literal Values\\nThis is a critical rule for filtering. Pay close attention to the source of the provided column values:\\n* Example Literals (NOT searched live): These are just samples.
