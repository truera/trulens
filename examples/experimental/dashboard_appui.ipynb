    "This notebook describes how to run your apps from the streamlit dashboard. Following this notebook, you should be able to access your apps and interact with them within the streamlit dashboard under the **Apps** page (see screenshot below). Make sure to check the **Setting up** section below to get your app in the list of apps on that page.\n",

Typing a message under *Your message* on the bottom of the window, and pressing enter, will run your app with that specified message as input, produce the app output, and add both to the chat transcript under the *Records* column.\n",

    "- Under the *Records* heading, you can add Selectors of record parts in a similar manner. Each added selectors will then be presented alongside each input-output pair in the transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When specifying selectors, you skip the \"Select.App\" or \"Select.Record\" part of those selectors. Also the \"RecordInput\" and \"RecordOutput\" (not that you would need them given they are in the transcript already) are specified as \"main_input\" and \"main_output\", respectively. \n",
