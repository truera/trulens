The following quotation is actually an anagram of one of the bard's most well known lines. I'd like you all to think about it and anyone who can provide the original line will get an automatic A on next week's quiz. Here's the anagram. In one of the bard's best thought of tragedies our insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the transcribed text for relevant information:\nThe transcribed text references \"the bard\" twice\nThe text contains the anagram to solve: \"In one of the bard's best thought of tragedies our insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten\"\nThe decoded text resolves as a well-known line of \"the bard\"\n\nStep 4: Using a web browser, access a search engine and conduct a search, \"who is the bard\"\nStep 5: Navigate to the first search result, https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/bard\nStep 6: Evaluate the page content, noting that the page identifies William Shakespeare as \"The Bard\"\nStep 7: Navigate to a search engine and conduct a search, \"William Shakespeare, In one of the bard's best thought of tragedies our insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten\"\nStep 8: Navigate to the first search result, https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~ltfang/humors/anagram.html\nStep 9: Evaluate the page content, noting that the page identifies the anagram of \"In one of the bard's best thought of tragedies our insistent hero Hamlet queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten\" as \"To be or not to be: that is the question, whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\"\nStep 10: Compare the information provided by the website resource to the original text, to determine if the original text and the candidate solution share the same letters. As this is the case, store this anagram as a candidate solution.\nStep 11: Navigate to a search engine and conduct a search, \"William Shakespeare, To be or not to be: that is the question, whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\"\nStep 12: Navigate to the first search result, https://poets.org/poem/hamlet-act-iii-scene-i-be-or-not-be\nStep 13: Evaluate the page content, learning that the phrase \"To be or not to be: that is the question, whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\" is a line from William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, which corresponds with both the clue provided by the professor in the initial text and the clue provided in the anagrammed text.\nStep 14: Confirming the accuracy of the surfaced result, provide the correct response to my user, formatted as requested, \"To be or not to be that is the question whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\"",

Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.\n\nTo solve the task above, you will have to use this attached file: - Attached audio: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3\n```\nYou can leverage these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nList of facts that you know:\n```\n### 1. Facts given in the task\n- The task requires solving an assignment about an anagram.\n- The professor provided a question in the form of an audio recording, which contains the original line to be anagrammed.\n- The file containing the audio recording is specified as: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3.\n- The answer must be limited exclusively to the anagram text generated from the original line and must not include any punctuation or additional commentary.\n- It is stated that all relevant tools are available and that failure to produce a correct answer is not acceptable.\n\n### 2. Facts to look up\n- The precise content of the professor\u2019s original question recorded in the audio file (data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3). This may involve using audio processing or transcription tools able to access that file.\n- Any additional guidelines or formatting details from the audio or accompanying documentation that clarify what constitutes an acceptable anagram output.\n\n### 3. Facts to derive\n- The exact text (transcription) of the professor\u2019s question from the provided audio file.\n- The correctly rearranged (anagram) version of the original line as per the professor's request.\n- Confirmation via logical verification or simulation steps to ensure the anagram is valid (i.e., it uses exactly the same letters as the original without punctuation and fulfills any additional implicit constraints from the professor\u2019s instruction).\n```\n\nNow begin!

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- inspect_file_as_text: \\nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\\\".html\\\", \\\".htm\\\", \\\".xlsx\\\", \\\".pptx\\\", \\\".wav\\\", \\\".mp3\\\", \\\".m4a\\\", \\\".flac\\\", \\\".pdf\\\", \\\".docx\\\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \\\"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\\\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\\n    Returns an output of type: string\\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\\n    Returns an output of type: any\\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

The question is in French.\nYou have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code:\n{'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}\"\n\nThought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image.\nCode:\n```py\ntranslated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang=\"French\", tgt_lang=\"English\")\nprint(f\"The translated question is {translated_question}.\")\nanswer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question)\nfinal_answer(f\"The answer is {answer}\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\nThought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\nThought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\nCode:\n```py\npages = search(query=\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\")\nprint(pages)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\nCode:\n```py\nfor url in [\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\", \"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\"]:\n    whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\n    print(whole_page)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*80 + \"\\n\")  # Print separator between pages\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\nThought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\" Let's answer in one word.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"diminished\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\nThought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities.\nCode:\n```py\nfor city in [\"Guangzhou\", \"Shanghai\"]:\n    print(f\"Population {city}:\", search(f\"{city} population\")\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\nThought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\nCode:\n```py\nfinal_answer(\"Shanghai\")\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\nThought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\nCode:\n```py\npope_age_wiki = wiki(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\", pope_age_wiki)\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\"current pope age\")\nprint(\"Pope age as per google search:\", pope_age_search)\n```<end_code>\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\nThought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\nCode:\n```py\npope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\n```<end_code>\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools:\n- visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.\n    Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n    Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    Returns an output of type: any\nYou can also give tasks to team members.\nCalling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.\nGiven that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.\nHere is a list of the team members that you can call:\n- search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.\n    Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.\n    Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!\n    And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.\n    Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

The professor's question consists of one original line spoken in the recording, and we need to generate an anagram from that line. The anagram should rearrange all the letters from the original line exactly (using each letter exactly once) and must not include any punctuation. Please listen carefully to the audio file, transcribe the exact original line, and then compute the anagram text accordingly. It is crucial that the final answer you return is only the anagram text (with no punctuation and no additional commentary). Provide as much verification steps as needed to be sure the answer is correct and meets the professor's instructions. Thank you!\\n---\\nYou're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.\\n\\nYour final_answer WILL HAVE to contain these parts:\\n### 1.

Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",

The professor's question consists of one original line spoken in the recording, and we need to generate an anagram from that line. The anagram should rearrange all the letters from the original line exactly (using each letter exactly once) and must not include any punctuation. Please listen carefully to the audio file, transcribe the exact original line, and then compute the anagram text accordingly.

Like \\\"Find me this information (...)\\\" rather than a few keywords.\\n    \\n\\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\\\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\\\")'.\\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions']\\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\\n10. Don't give up!

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\nThought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\nCode:\n```py\nanswer = document_qa(document=document, question=\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\")\nprint(answer)\n```<end_code>\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\nThought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\nCode:\n```py\nimage = image_generator(\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\")\nfinal_answer(image)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\nThought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\nCode:\n```py\nresult = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\nfinal_answer(result)\n```<end_code>\n\n---\nTask:\n\"Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`.

This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}\n    Returns an output of type: string\n- inspect_file_as_text: \nYou cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.\nThis tool handles the following file extensions: [\".html\", \".htm\", \".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n    Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': \"The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!\", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible.

Like \"Find me this information (...)\" rather than a few keywords.\n    \n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail.\n2. Use only variables that you have defined!\n3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions']\n9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.",
