           [USER]: Below I will present you a task.  You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need. To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it. Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:  --- ### 1. Facts given in the task List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).  ### 2. Facts to look up List here any facts that we may need to look up. Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.  ### 3. Facts to derive List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.  Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings: ### 1. Facts given in the task ### 2. Facts to look up ### 3. Facts to derive Do not add anything else.  Here is the task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: Could you help me out with this assignment? Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.  To solve the task above, you will have to use this attached file: - Attached audio: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3 ``` Now begin!
           [ASSISTANT]: ### 1. Facts given in the task - The task requires solving an assignment about an anagram. - The professor provided a question in the form of an audio recording, which contains the original line to be anagrammed. - The file containing the audio recording is specified as: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3. - The answer must be limited exclusively to the anagram text generated from the original line and must not include any punctuation or additional commentary. - It is stated that all relevant tools are available and that failure to produce a correct answer is not acceptable.  ### 2. Facts to look up - The precise content of the professor’s original question recorded in the audio file (data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3). This may involve using audio processing or transcription tools able to access that file. - Any additional guidelines or formatting details from the audio or accompanying documentation that clarify what constitutes an acceptable anagram output.  ### 3. Facts to derive - The exact text (transcription) of the professor’s question from the provided audio file. - The correctly rearranged (anagram) version of the original line as per the professor's request. - Confirmation via logical verification or simulation steps to ensure the anagram is valid (i.e., it uses exactly the same letters as the original without punctuation and fulfills any additional implicit constraints from the professor’s instruction).

           [USER]: You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.  Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts. This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS. After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.  Here is your task:  Task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer.

Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [".html", ".htm", ".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.     Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': "The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}     Returns an output of type: string - final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.     Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       List of facts that you know: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task - The task requires solving an assignment about an anagram. - The professor provided a question in the form of an audio recording, which contains the original line to be anagrammed. - The file containing the audio recording is specified as: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3. - The answer must be limited exclusively to the anagram text generated from the original line and must not include any punctuation or additional commentary. - It is stated that all relevant tools are available and that failure to produce a correct answer is not acceptable.  ### 2.

Write your plan below.
           [ASSISTANT]: 1. Use the inspect_file_as_text tool to extract the transcription from the provided MP3 audio file. 2. Parse the transcription to identify the specific original line that needs to be transformed into an anagram. 3. Analyze the professor's instructions to understand that the final output must be the anagram (with no punctuation) generated from the original line. 4. Generate the anagram by rearranging the letters of the original line ensuring that every letter is used exactly once. 5. Verify that the generated anagram meets all conditions: it uses exactly the same letters as the original, contains no punctuation, and follows the professor’s requirements. 6. Submit the final answer (the anagram text only) using the final_answer tool.

             [SYSTEM]: You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can. To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code. To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.  Here are a few examples using notional tools: --- Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."  Thought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer. Code: ```py answer = document_qa(document=document, question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?") print(answer) ```<end_code> Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."  Thought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person. Code: ```py image = image_generator("A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.") final_answer(image) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"  Thought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool Code: ```py result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678 final_answer(result) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French. You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code: {'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}"  Thought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image. Code: ```py translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English") print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.") answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question) final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}") ```<end_code>  --- Task: In a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer. What does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?  Thought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: No result found for query "1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein".  Thought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: Found 6 pages: [Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)  [Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)  (truncated)  Thought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more. Code: ```py for url in ["https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/", "https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/"]:     whole_page = visit_webpage(url)     print(whole_page)     print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")  # Print separator between pages ```<end_code> Observation: Manhattan Project Locations: Los Alamos, NM Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at (truncated)  Thought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: "He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity." Let's answer in one word. Code: ```py final_answer("diminished") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?"  Thought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities. Code: ```py for city in ["Guangzhou", "Shanghai"]:     print(f"Population {city}:", search(f"{city} population") ```<end_code> Observation: Population Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'] Population Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'  Thought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population. Code: ```py final_answer("Shanghai") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?"  Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search. Code: ```py pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki) pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search) ```<end_code> Observation: Pope age: "The pope Francis is currently 88 years old."  Thought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code. Code: ```py pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36 final_answer(pope_current_age) ```<end_code>  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools: - visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.     Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.

Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task: 1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail. 2. Use only variables that you have defined! 3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'. 4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block. 5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters. 6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'. 7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables. 8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['math', 'PIL', 'torch', 'statistics', 'numpy', 're', 'scipy', 'pptx', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'os', 'stat', 'requests', 'pydub', 'PyPDF2', 'xml', 'time', 'json', 'pandas', 'csv', 'queue', 'collections', 'zipfile', 'unicodedata', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'bs4', 'Bio', 'random', 'datetime', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'chess', 'fractions'] 9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist. 10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
             [USER]: New task: You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: Could you help me out with this assignment? Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out.

               [USER]: Below I will present you a task.  You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need. To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it. Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:  --- ### 1. Facts given in the task List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).  ### 2. Facts to look up List here any facts that we may need to look up. Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.  ### 3. Facts to derive List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.  Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings: ### 1. Facts given in the task ### 2. Facts to look up ### 3. Facts to derive Do not add anything else.  Here is the task: ``` You're a helpful agent named 'search_agent'. You have been submitted this task by your manager. --- Task: Hello team, I need your help with an assignment: Our professor, at the end of class on Friday, asked a question which is provided as an audio recording located at 'data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3'. The professor's question consists of one original line spoken in the recording, and we need to generate an anagram from that line. The anagram should rearrange all the letters from the original line exactly (using each letter exactly once) and must not include any punctuation. Please listen carefully to the audio file, transcribe the exact original line, and then compute the anagram text accordingly. It is crucial that the final answer you return is only the anagram text (with no punctuation and no additional commentary). Provide as much verification steps as needed to be sure the answer is correct and meets the professor's instructions. Thank you! --- You're helping your manager solve a wider task: so make sure to not provide a one-line answer, but give as much information as possible to give them a clear understanding of the answer.

Verify the transcription carefully to ensure it exactly reproduces the professor’s words, checking for any punctuation or deviations.   3. Remove any punctuation from the transcribed line to create a clean version suitable for anagram generation.   4. Generate an anagram from the clean transcribed text by rearranging all letters exactly once, ensuring that every letter from the original transcription is used exactly once in the rearranged order.   5. Verify that the anagram is correct by comparing the letter frequency of the anagram with that of the cleaned transcription to confirm all letters match exactly.   6. Use the final_answer tool to return a structured answer containing:     • A short version of the task outcome (the anagram text only, with no punctuation).     • An extremely detailed version explaining each verification and transformation step.     • Additional context describing any assumptions or methods used.

                 [SYSTEM]: You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using  tool calls. You will be given a task to solve as best you can. To do so, you have been given access to some tools.  The tool call you write is an action: after the tool is executed, you will get the result of the tool call as an "observation". This Action/Observation can repeat N times, you should take several steps when needed.  You can use the result of the previous action as input for the next action. The observation will always be a string: it can represent a file, like "image_1.jpg". Then you can use it as input for the next action. You can do it for instance as follows:  Observation: "image_1.jpg"  Action: {   "name": "image_transformer",   "arguments": {"image": "image_1.jpg"} }  To provide the final answer to the task, use an action blob with "name": "final_answer" tool. It is the only way to complete the task, else you will be stuck on a loop. So your final output should look like this: Action: {   "name": "final_answer",   "arguments": {"answer": "insert your final answer here"} }   Here are a few examples using notional tools: --- Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."  Action: {   "name": "document_qa",   "arguments": {"document": "document.pdf", "question": "Who is the oldest person mentioned?"} } Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."  Action: {   "name": "image_generator",   "arguments": {"prompt": "A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada."} } Observation: "image.png"  Action: {   "name": "final_answer",   "arguments": "image.png" }  --- Task: "What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"  Action: {     "name": "python_interpreter",     "arguments": {"code": "5 + 3 + 1294.678"} } Observation: 1302.678  Action: {   "name": "final_answer",   "arguments": "1302.678" }  --- Task: "Which city has the highest population , Guangzhou or Shanghai?"  Action: {     "name": "search",     "arguments": "Population Guangzhou" } Observation: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']   Action: {     "name": "search",     "arguments": "Population Shanghai" } Observation: '26 million (2019)'  Action: {   "name": "final_answer",   "arguments": "Shanghai" }  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. You only have access to these tools: - web_search: Perform a web search query (think a google search) and returns the search results.     Takes inputs: {'query': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The web search query to perform.'}, 'filter_year': {'type': 'string', 'description': "[Optional parameter]: filter the search results to only include pages from a specific year.

Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any  Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task: 1. ALWAYS provide a tool call, else you will fail. 2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. Never use variable names as the action arguments, use the value instead. 3. Call a tool only when needed: do not call the search agent if you do not need information, try to solve the task yourself. If no tool call is needed, use final_answer tool to return your answer. 4. Never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.

Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: Could you help me out with this assignment? Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.  To solve the task above, you will have to use this attached file: - Attached audio: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3  Your team then worked diligently to address that request.

         [USER]: [FACTS LIST]: Here are the facts that I know so far: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task - The task requires solving an assignment about an anagram. - The professor provided a question in the form of an audio recording, which contains the original line to be anagrammed. - The file containing the audio recording is specified as: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3. - The answer must be limited exclusively to the anagram text generated from the original line and must not include any punctuation or additional commentary. - It is stated that all relevant tools are available and that failure to produce a correct answer is not acceptable.  ### 2. Facts to look up - The precise content of the professor’s original question recorded in the audio file (data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3). This may involve using audio processing or transcription tools able to access that file. - Any additional guidelines or formatting details from the audio or accompanying documentation that clarify what constitutes an acceptable anagram output.  ### 3. Facts to derive - The exact text (transcription) of the professor’s question from the provided audio file. - The correctly rearranged (anagram) version of the original line as per the professor's request. - Confirmation via logical verification or simulation steps to ensure the anagram is valid (i.e., it uses exactly the same letters as the original without punctuation and fulfills any additional implicit constraints from the professor’s instruction). ```

Following that, an anagram of the transcription had to be generated by rearranging all letters exactly once and omitting punctuation.

         [USER]:  Read the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question. The question is repeated here for convenience:  You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: Could you help me out with this assignment? Our professor sprung it on us at the end of class Friday, and I'm still trying to figure it out. The question he asked us was about an anagram. I've attached an audio recording of the question that he asked, so if you could please take a listen and give me the answer, I'd really appreciate the help. Please limit your response to the anagram text that could be generated from the original line which fulfills the professor's request, without any other commentary. Also, please don't include any punctuation in your response.  To solve the task above, you will have to use this attached file: - Attached audio: data/gaia/validation/2b3ef98c-cc05-450b-a719-711aee40ac65.mp3  To output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER] Your FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. ADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.) If you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings. If you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'
