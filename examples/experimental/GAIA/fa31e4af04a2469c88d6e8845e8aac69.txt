           [USER]: Below I will present you a task.  You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need. To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it. Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:  --- ### 1. Facts given in the task List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).  ### 2. Facts to look up List here any facts that we may need to look up. Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.  ### 3. Facts to derive List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.  Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings: ### 1. Facts given in the task ### 2. Facts to look up ### 3. Facts to derive Do not add anything else.  Here is the task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number. ``` Now begin!
           [ASSISTANT]: ### 1. Facts given in the task • The list of attendees and their relationships is provided in groups:    – My married mother and father (2 adults)    – My twin brother and his family (which includes him as an adult, his spouse as an adult, and two kids)    – My aunt and her family (which includes the aunt as an adult, her spouse as an adult, and one six‐year‐old child)    – My grandma and her brother (both adults; note that although grandma is married, her spouse, the grandpa, passed away last year, so he is not attending; however, grandma’s brother is married and his spouse is present)    – My grandma’s brother’s daughter and his daughter’s family (this gives one adult—the daughter—plus her spouse, and her three kids under 12)   • All adults (other than me) are married (so in every “family” group the listed adult comes with a spouse if not explicitly given otherwise, with the exception of widowed individuals, as noted for grandma).   • All living spouses are attending.   • Two of my twin brother’s children are “still kids” (i.e. they are to be counted as children).   • The aunt has one six‐year‐old.   • The grandma’s brother’s daughter has three kids under 12.   • Each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about ½ a potato, except my second cousins do not eat carbs.   • It is stated that my second cousins don’t eat carbs; by the family relationships provided, the three kids from my grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family (group “his daughter’s family”) qualify as second cousins.   • The average potato weighs about ½ pound.   • Potatoes are sold in 5‑pound bags.  ### 2. Facts to look up • No external facts appear to be needed. All relevant quantities (e.g. average potato weight, bag size) and family details are provided in the text.   • If necessary, one could re–check the family relationship definitions or use a family tree diagram, but the task itself supplies all information required.  ### 3. Facts to derive • Derive the total number of adults attending by accounting for the given groups and the condition that all adults (except me) are married (adding spouses where not explicitly mentioned):    – Parents: 2    – Twin brother’s family: twin brother + spouse = 2    – Aunt’s family: aunt + spouse = 2    – Grandma’s side: grandma (widowed, so no spouse) + grandma’s brother + his spouse = 3    – Grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family: the daughter + her spouse = 2    → Total adults = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 11  • Derive the total number of kids eating mashed potatoes by identifying those whose consumption is counted (noting that the three kids from the daughter’s family are second cousins and do NOT eat carbs):    – Twin brother’s family: 2 kids    – Aunt’s family: 1 kid    – Grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family: 3 kids, but these are second cousins and so their consumption is 0    → Total kids eating = 2 + 1 = 3  • Compute the total number of potatoes needed using the consumption rates:    – Adults: 11 × 1.5 = 16.5 potatoes    – Kids: 3 × 0.5 = 1.5 potatoes    → Total potatoes = 16.5 + 1.5 = 18 potatoes  • Convert the total number of potatoes to pounds (given that each potato weighs ½ pound):    – Total pounds = 18 × 0.5 = 9 pounds  • Determine how many 5‑pound bags are needed by dividing total pounds by bag size and rounding up to the next whole bag:    – Bags needed = Ceiling(9 / 5) = Ceiling(1.8) = 2 bags

           [USER]: You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.  Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts. This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS. After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       List of facts that you know: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The list of attendees and their relationships is provided in groups:    – My married mother and father (2 adults)    – My twin brother and his family (which includes him as an adult, his spouse as an adult, and two kids)    – My aunt and her family (which includes the aunt as an adult, her spouse as an adult, and one six‐year‐old child)    – My grandma and her brother (both adults; note that although grandma is married, her spouse, the grandpa, passed away last year, so he is not attending; however, grandma’s brother is married and his spouse is present)    – My grandma’s brother’s daughter and his daughter’s family (this gives one adult—the daughter—plus her spouse, and her three kids under 12)   • All adults (other than me) are married (so in every “family” group the listed adult comes with a spouse if not explicitly given otherwise, with the exception of widowed individuals, as noted for grandma).   • All living spouses are attending.   • Two of my twin brother’s children are “still kids” (i.e. they are to be counted as children).   • The aunt has one six‐year‐old.   • The grandma’s brother’s daughter has three kids under 12.   • Each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about ½ a potato, except my second cousins do not eat carbs.   • It is stated that my second cousins don’t eat carbs; by the family relationships provided, the three kids from my grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family (group “his daughter’s family”) qualify as second cousins.   • The average potato weighs about ½ pound.   • Potatoes are sold in 5‑pound bags.  ### 2.

Write your plan below.
           [ASSISTANT]: 1. Parse the problem details and list all family groups along with their relationships. 2. Determine the total number of adults attending by adding the adults from each group, ensuring to include spouses as specified. 3. Calculate the total number of children eating mashed potatoes by identifying the kids in each group, excluding the second cousins who do not eat carbs. 4. Compute the total mashed potatoes needed in potatoes by multiplying the number of adults by 1.5 and the number of kids by 0.5, then summing these amounts. 5. Convert the total number of potatoes to pounds by using the conversion rate (each potato weighs ½ pound). 6. Determine how many 5‑pound bags are needed by dividing the total pounds of potatoes by 5 and rounding up to the nearest whole bag. 7. Provide the final answer as the number of whole bags required.

             [SYSTEM]: You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can. To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code. To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.  Here are a few examples using notional tools: --- Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."  Thought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer. Code: ```py answer = document_qa(document=document, question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?") print(answer) ```<end_code> Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."  Thought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person. Code: ```py image = image_generator("A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.") final_answer(image) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"  Thought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool Code: ```py result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678 final_answer(result) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French. You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code: {'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}"  Thought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image. Code: ```py translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English") print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.") answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question) final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}") ```<end_code>  --- Task: In a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer. What does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?  Thought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: No result found for query "1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein".  Thought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: Found 6 pages: [Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)  [Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)  (truncated)  Thought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more. Code: ```py for url in ["https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/", "https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/"]:     whole_page = visit_webpage(url)     print(whole_page)     print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")  # Print separator between pages ```<end_code> Observation: Manhattan Project Locations: Los Alamos, NM Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at (truncated)  Thought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: "He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity." Let's answer in one word. Code: ```py final_answer("diminished") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?"  Thought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities. Code: ```py for city in ["Guangzhou", "Shanghai"]:     print(f"Population {city}:", search(f"{city} population") ```<end_code> Observation: Population Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'] Population Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'  Thought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population. Code: ```py final_answer("Shanghai") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?"  Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search. Code: ```py pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki) pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search) ```<end_code> Observation: Pope age: "The pope Francis is currently 88 years old."  Thought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code. Code: ```py pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36 final_answer(pope_current_age) ```<end_code>  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools: - visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.     Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.

Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.

And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task: 1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail. 2. Use only variables that you have defined! 3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'. 4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block. 5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters. 6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'. 7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables. 8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'zipfile', 'pydub', 'unicodedata', 'random', 'time', 'sympy', 'sklearn', 'scipy', 'PIL', 'xml', 'PyPDF2', 'requests', 'yahoo_finance', 'csv', 'itertools', 'os', 're', 'pandas', 'fractions', 'queue', 'stat', 'json', 'pubchempy', 'bs4', 'numpy', 'pptx', 'statistics', 'torch', 'io', 'math', 'Bio', 'chess'] 9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist. 10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
             [USER]: New task: You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.
             [ASSISTANT]: [FACTS LIST]: Here are the facts that I know so far: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The list of attendees and their relationships is provided in groups:    – My married mother and father (2 adults)    – My twin brother and his family (which includes him as an adult, his spouse as an adult, and two kids)    – My aunt and her family (which includes the aunt as an adult, her spouse as an adult, and one six‐year‐old child)    – My grandma and her brother (both adults; note that although grandma is married, her spouse, the grandpa, passed away last year, so he is not attending; however, grandma’s brother is married and his spouse is present)    – My grandma’s brother’s daughter and his daughter’s family (this gives one adult—the daughter—plus her spouse, and her three kids under 12)   • All adults (other than me) are married (so in every “family” group the listed adult comes with a spouse if not explicitly given otherwise, with the exception of widowed individuals, as noted for grandma).   • All living spouses are attending.   • Two of my twin brother’s children are “still kids” (i.e. they are to be counted as children).   • The aunt has one six‐year‐old.   • The grandma’s brother’s daughter has three kids under 12.   • Each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about ½ a potato, except my second cousins do not eat carbs.   • It is stated that my second cousins don’t eat carbs; by the family relationships provided, the three kids from my grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family (group “his daughter’s family”) qualify as second cousins.   • The average potato weighs about ½ pound.   • Potatoes are sold in 5‑pound bags.  ### 2. Facts to look up • No external facts appear to be needed. All relevant quantities (e.g. average potato weight, bag size) and family details are provided in the text.   • If necessary, one could re–check the family relationship definitions or use a family tree diagram, but the task itself supplies all information required.  ### 3. Facts to derive • Derive the total number of adults attending by accounting for the given groups and the condition that all adults (except me) are married (adding spouses where not explicitly mentioned):    – Parents: 2    – Twin brother’s family: twin brother + spouse = 2    – Aunt’s family: aunt + spouse = 2    – Grandma’s side: grandma (widowed, so no spouse) + grandma’s brother + his spouse = 3    – Grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family: the daughter + her spouse = 2    → Total adults = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 11  • Derive the total number of kids eating mashed potatoes by identifying those whose consumption is counted (noting that the three kids from the daughter’s family are second cousins and do NOT eat carbs):    – Twin brother’s family: 2 kids    – Aunt’s family: 1 kid    – Grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family: 3 kids, but these are second cousins and so their consumption is 0    → Total kids eating = 2 + 1 = 3  • Compute the total number of potatoes needed using the consumption rates:    – Adults: 11 × 1.5 = 16.5 potatoes    – Kids: 3 × 0.5 = 1.5 potatoes    → Total potatoes = 16.5 + 1.5 = 18 potatoes  • Convert the total number of potatoes to pounds (given that each potato weighs ½ pound):    – Total pounds = 18 × 0.5 = 9 pounds  • Determine how many 5‑pound bags are needed by dividing total pounds by bag size and rounding up to the next whole bag:    – Bags needed = Ceiling(9 / 5) = Ceiling(1.8) = 2 bags ```
             [ASSISTANT]: [PLAN]: Here is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task: ``` 1. Parse the problem details and list all family groups along with their relationships. 2. Determine the total number of adults attending by adding the adults from each group, ensuring to include spouses as specified. 3. Calculate the total number of children eating mashed potatoes by identifying the kids in each group, excluding the second cousins who do not eat carbs. 4. Compute the total mashed potatoes needed in potatoes by multiplying the number of adults by 1.5 and the number of kids by 0.5, then summing these amounts. 5. Convert the total number of potatoes to pounds by using the conversion rate (each potato weighs ½ pound). 6. Determine how many 5‑pound bags are needed by dividing the total pounds of potatoes by 5 and rounding up to the nearest whole bag. 7. Provide the final answer as the number of whole bags required.   ```
             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: I will re-read and break down the family list from the task. The attendees are described as follows (and note that I do not attend):  1. My married mother and father → 2 adults. 2. My twin brother and his family. Since all adults (other than me) are married:   • Twin brother + his spouse = 2 adults.   • They have 2 kids (both eat potatoes). 3. My aunt and her family →    • Aunt + her spouse = 2 adults.   • They have 1 six‐year‐old child. 4. My grandma and her brother →    • Grandma is attending as an adult (although since her spouse, my grandpa, died, he is not included).   • Her brother is married so his spouse is attending; that gives 2 adults (brother + spouse).   • Thus total = 1 + 2 = 3 adults. 5. My grandma’s brother’s daughter, and his daughter’s family. This is read as a continuation:   • Grandma’s brother (from group 4) has a daughter; she is an adult and, like all adults, is married, so she and her spouse attend = 2 adults.   • It is stated that “my grandma’s brother’s daughter has three kids under 12.” However, these children (my second cousins) do not eat carbs.  Now, let’s total the numbers: • Adults: 2 (parents) + 2 (twin brother’s family) + 2 (aunt’s family) + 3 (grandma and her brother’s group) + 2 (grandma’s brother’s daughter and spouse) = 11 adults. • Kids eating potatoes: 2 (twin brother’s kids) + 1 (aunt’s kid) = 3 kids. (The three kids from the grandma’s brother’s daughter’s family are second cousins and do not eat carbs.)  Consumption per person: • Each adult eats 1.5 potatoes → 11 × 1.5 = 16.5 potatoes. • Each kid eats 0.5 potato → 3 × 0.5 = 1.5 potatoes. • Total potatoes needed = 16.5 + 1.5 = 18 potatoes.  Converting to weight: • Each potato weighs about 0.5 pounds → 18 × 0.5 = 9 pounds of potatoes.  Potatoes are sold in 5‑pound bags, so calculate the bags needed: • Bags = ceiling(9 / 5) = ceiling(1.8) = 2 bags.  Code: ```py import math  # Calculate the total number of adults and kids adults = 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2  # = 11 adults kids_eating = 2 + 1       # = 3 kids  # Calculate potatoes required potatoes_adults = adults * 1.5  # each adult eats 1.5 potatoes potatoes_kids = kids_eating * 0.5  # each kid eats 0.5 potato total_potatoes = potatoes_adults + potatoes_kids  # = 18 potatoes  # Convert to pounds (each potato is 0.5 lb) total_pounds = total_potatoes * 0.5  # 18 * 0.5 = 9 pounds  # Bags needed (each bag is 5 lbs), round up bags_needed = math.ceil(total_pounds / 5)  print(bags_needed)  # Should print 2 ```

         [SYSTEM]: Earlier you were asked the following:  You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: My family reunion is this week, and I was assigned the mashed potatoes to bring. The attendees include my married mother and father, my twin brother and his family, my aunt and her family, my grandma and her brother, her brother's daughter, and his daughter's family. All the adults but me have been married, and no one is divorced or remarried, but my grandpa and my grandma's sister-in-law passed away last year. All living spouses are attending. My brother has two children that are still kids, my aunt has one six-year-old, and my grandma's brother's daughter has three kids under 12. I figure each adult will eat about 1.5 potatoes of mashed potatoes and each kid will eat about 1/2 a potato of mashed potatoes, except my second cousins don't eat carbs. The average potato is about half a pound, and potatoes are sold in 5-pound bags. How many whole bags of potatoes do I need? Just give the number.  Your team then worked diligently to address that request. Read below a transcript of that conversation:
