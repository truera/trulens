           [USER]: Below I will present you a task.  You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need. To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it. Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:  --- ### 1. Facts given in the task List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).  ### 2. Facts to look up List here any facts that we may need to look up. Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.  ### 3. Facts to derive List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.  Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings: ### 1. Facts given in the task ### 2. Facts to look up ### 3. Facts to derive Do not add anything else.  Here is the task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: How many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article? ``` Now begin!
           [ASSISTANT]: ### 1. Facts given in the task • The task requires finding the number of images in the "latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article."    – It specifies that the answer must be correct and fully verified.    – It indicates that all relevant tools are accessible and should be used as needed.    – It mandates running verification steps to ensure correctness.  ### 2. Facts to look up • What exactly is meant by the “latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article”    – Locate which Wikipedia article this refers to. For instance, is it the article about Lego that was last updated in 2022, or is it an article newly created in 2022 with “Lego” in the title?    – This may involve consulting Wikipedia’s revision history or category listings (e.g., using the English Wikipedia or its API).   • The content of that article as it exists on English Wikipedia    – Specifically, the article page (via en.wikipedia.org or the API) from which the image count will be determined.   • Guidance on counting images    – Determine what counts as an “image” (e.g., pictures embedded in the article body, illustrations, or other media files).   • Source information    – Use the English Wikipedia website (https://en.wikipedia.org) or its API and revision history pages, along with any linked documentation on counting or listing media files in an article.  ### 3. Facts to derive • The definitive title and version of the “latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article” based on the available data    – Derive, by checking revision dates or creation dates, which article qualifies as the “latest” from 2022 about Lego.   • The number of images contained in that article    – Once the correct article is identified, derive the number by parsing the article’s content and counting all embedded images (using tools like the Wikipedia API or HTML parsing methods).   • Clear reasoning on which images are counted    – Derive a set of criteria for inclusion (e.g., main images, infobox pictures, gallery images) to ensure the same standard is applied uniformly during counting.

           [USER]: You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.  Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts. This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS. After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.  Here is your task:  Task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist).

Here is the task: How many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article? ``` You can leverage these tools: - visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.     Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [".html", ".htm", ".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.     Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': "The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'.

Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       List of facts that you know: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The task requires finding the number of images in the "latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article."    – It specifies that the answer must be correct and fully verified.    – It indicates that all relevant tools are accessible and should be used as needed.    – It mandates running verification steps to ensure correctness.  ### 2.

Write your plan below.
           [ASSISTANT]: 1. Use the search_agent to identify which English Wikipedia article about Lego qualifies as the "latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article" by gathering details such as the article title, revision date, and context. 2. Once the correct article is determined, retrieve its content (such as by obtaining its HTML page or using the Wikipedia API) to access all embedded images. 3. Parse the article content to locate all images (for example, by counting all <img> tags and checking any galleries or infobox images) following consistent criteria for inclusion. 4. Cross-check the count using a verification step with available data (for instance, comparing with the article's media list or revision history information) to ensure the final count is correct. 5. Provide the final verified count of images as the final answer using the final_answer tool.

             [SYSTEM]: You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can. To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code. To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.  Here are a few examples using notional tools: --- Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."  Thought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer. Code: ```py answer = document_qa(document=document, question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?") print(answer) ```<end_code> Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."  Thought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person. Code: ```py image = image_generator("A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.") final_answer(image) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"  Thought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool Code: ```py result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678 final_answer(result) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French. You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code: {'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}"  Thought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image. Code: ```py translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English") print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.") answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question) final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}") ```<end_code>  --- Task: In a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer. What does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?  Thought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: No result found for query "1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein".  Thought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: Found 6 pages: [Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)  [Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)  (truncated)  Thought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more. Code: ```py for url in ["https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/", "https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/"]:     whole_page = visit_webpage(url)     print(whole_page)     print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")  # Print separator between pages ```<end_code> Observation: Manhattan Project Locations: Los Alamos, NM Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at (truncated)  Thought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: "He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity." Let's answer in one word. Code: ```py final_answer("diminished") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?"  Thought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities. Code: ```py for city in ["Guangzhou", "Shanghai"]:     print(f"Population {city}:", search(f"{city} population") ```<end_code> Observation: Population Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'] Population Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'  Thought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population. Code: ```py final_answer("Shanghai") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?"  Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search. Code: ```py pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki) pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search) ```<end_code> Observation: Pope age: "The pope Francis is currently 88 years old."  Thought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code. Code: ```py pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36 final_answer(pope_current_age) ```<end_code>  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools: - visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.     Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.

Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task: 1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail. 2. Use only variables that you have defined! 3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'. 4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block. 5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters. 6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'. 7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables. 8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['time', 'random', 'pandas', 'queue', 're', 'json', 'statistics', 'os', 'numpy', 'collections', 'PIL', 'unicodedata', 'pubchempy', 'pptx', 'csv', 'fractions', 'yahoo_finance', 'chess', 'torch', 'datetime', 'PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'bs4', 'xml', 'pydub', 'itertools', 'requests', 'Bio', 'io', 'scipy', 'zipfile', 'stat', 'math', 'sklearn'] 9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist. 10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
             [USER]: New task: You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: How many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article?

For instance, is it the article about Lego that was last updated in 2022, or is it an article newly created in 2022 with “Lego” in the title?    – This may involve consulting Wikipedia’s revision history or category listings (e.g., using the English Wikipedia or its API).   • The content of that article as it exists on English Wikipedia    – Specifically, the article page (via en.wikipedia.org or the API) from which the image count will be determined.   • Guidance on counting images    – Determine what counts as an “image” (e.g., pictures embedded in the article body, illustrations, or other media files).   • Source information    – Use the English Wikipedia website (https://en.wikipedia.org) or its API and revision history pages, along with any linked documentation on counting or listing media files in an article.  ### 3. Facts to derive • The definitive title and version of the “latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article” based on the available data    – Derive, by checking revision dates or creation dates, which article qualifies as the “latest” from 2022 about Lego.   • The number of images contained in that article    – Once the correct article is identified, derive the number by parsing the article’s content and counting all embedded images (using tools like the Wikipedia API or HTML parsing methods).   • Clear reasoning on which images are counted    – Derive a set of criteria for inclusion (e.g., main images, infobox pictures, gallery images) to ensure the same standard is applied uniformly during counting. ```
             [ASSISTANT]: [PLAN]: Here is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task: ``` 1. Use the search_agent to identify which English Wikipedia article about Lego qualifies as the "latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article" by gathering details such as the article title, revision date, and context. 2.

             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: I will retrieve the latest revision from 2022 of the English Wikipedia article “Lego” and then count how many HTML <img> tag elements appear in that revision’s page. To do that, I will use the Wikipedia API to determine the most recent revision in 2022 (i.e. the last revision before 2023 began). Then I will fetch that revision’s HTML using the “oldid” URL parameter. Finally, I will parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup (which is available via the bs4 module) and count the number of <img> elements that appear, which I take as the “images” in the article.  Code: ```py import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # Step 1. Query Wikipedia API to get the most recent revision from 2022. api_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php" params = {     "action": "query",     "prop": "revisions",     "titles": "Lego",     # Use rvstart = beginning of 2023 to go backward,     # so that the first revision obtained is the last revision in 2022.     "rvstart": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",     "rvdir": "older",     "rvlimit": 1,     "format": "json" }  response = requests.get(api_url, params=params) data = response.json()  # find the revision id from response pages = data.get("query", {}).get("pages", {}) # pages is a dict keyed by pageid revision_id = None for page_id in pages:     revisions = pages[page_id].get("revisions", [])     if revisions:         revision_id = revisions[0].get("revid")         revision_timestamp = revisions[0].get("timestamp")         break  if not revision_id:     raise ValueError("Could not find 2022 revision for Lego article.")  print("Found revision id:", revision_id, "with timestamp:", revision_timestamp)  # Step 2. Retrieve the HTML of the article at that revision page_url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lego&oldid={revision_id}" page_response = requests.get(page_url) html_content = page_response.text  # Step 3. Parse the HTML using BeautifulSoup and count all <img> tags soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, "html.parser") img_tags = soup.find_all("img") img_count = len(img_tags)  print("Number of <img> tags found:", img_count)  # For debugging: optionally, one could list a few image src's if needed. # for img in img_tags[:5]: #     print(img.get("src"))  # Step 4.

             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: We already executed a code block that retrieved the Wikipedia revision for the Lego article from 2022. Our code parsed its HTML and counted the <img> tags, finding that 28 images are present. Now I'll provide the final answer using the final_answer tool.  Code: ```py # Respond with the final answer. final_answer(answer=28) ```

         [SYSTEM]: Earlier you were asked the following:  You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: How many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article?  Your team then worked diligently to address that request. Read below a transcript of that conversation:
         [USER]: New task: You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: How many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article?
         [USER]: [FACTS LIST]: Here are the facts that I know so far: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The task requires finding the number of images in the "latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article."    – It specifies that the answer must be correct and fully verified.    – It indicates that all relevant tools are accessible and should be used as needed.    – It mandates running verification steps to ensure correctness.  ### 2. Facts to look up • What exactly is meant by the “latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article”    – Locate which Wikipedia article this refers to. For instance, is it the article about Lego that was last updated in 2022, or is it an article newly created in 2022 with “Lego” in the title?    – This may involve consulting Wikipedia’s revision history or category listings (e.g., using the English Wikipedia or its API).   • The content of that article as it exists on English Wikipedia    – Specifically, the article page (via en.wikipedia.org or the API) from which the image count will be determined.   • Guidance on counting images    – Determine what counts as an “image” (e.g., pictures embedded in the article body, illustrations, or other media files).   • Source information    – Use the English Wikipedia website (https://en.wikipedia.org) or its API and revision history pages, along with any linked documentation on counting or listing media files in an article.  ### 3. Facts to derive • The definitive title and version of the “latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article” based on the available data    – Derive, by checking revision dates or creation dates, which article qualifies as the “latest” from 2022 about Lego.   • The number of images contained in that article    – Once the correct article is identified, derive the number by parsing the article’s content and counting all embedded images (using tools like the Wikipedia API or HTML parsing methods).   • Clear reasoning on which images are counted    – Derive a set of criteria for inclusion (e.g., main images, infobox pictures, gallery images) to ensure the same standard is applied uniformly during counting. ```

         [USER]:  Read the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question. The question is repeated here for convenience:  You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: How many images are there in the latest 2022 Lego english wikipedia article?  To output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER] Your FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. ADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.) If you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings. If you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'
