           [USER]: Below I will present you a task.  You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need. To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it. Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:  --- ### 1. Facts given in the task List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).  ### 2. Facts to look up List here any facts that we may need to look up. Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.  ### 3. Facts to derive List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.  Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings: ### 1. Facts given in the task ### 2. Facts to look up ### 3. Facts to derive Do not add anything else.  Here is the task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: Of the cities within the United States where U.S. presidents were born, which two are the farthest apart from the westernmost to the easternmost going east, giving the city names only? Give them to me in alphabetical order, in a comma-separated list ``` Now begin!
           [ASSISTANT]: ### 1. Facts given in the task • The task focuses exclusively on cities within the United States that are birthplaces of U.S. presidents.   • The answer must consist of two city names: one corresponding to the far western birthplace and the other corresponding to the far eastern birthplace among those cities.   • The final response should present the two city names in alphabetical order as a comma-separated list.   • It is stated that all relevant tools needed to solve the task are at our disposal, and the correct answer exists.  ### 2. Facts to look up • The complete list of U.S. presidents along with their birth cities. (Potential sources: Wikipedia pages like “List of presidents of the United States” or “Presidential birthplaces”.)   • The geographical coordinates (or relative locations) of each of those birth cities, to determine which cities are the farthest east and west. (Potential sources: Geographical databases such as Google Maps, U.S. Geological Survey data, or other verified geographic information sites.)   • Verification sources that confirm the birth locations and their coordinates to ensure accuracy. (For instance, presidential library websites or authoritative history reference books.)  ### 3. Facts to derive • Determine, from the looked-up birth cities and their geographic coordinates, which city is the farthest west among those birthplaces.   • Determine, from the looked-up birth cities and their geographic coordinates, which city is the farthest east among those birthplaces.   • From the above derivations, form the final answer by listing these two cities in alphabetical order, using a comma to separate them.

           [USER]: You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.  Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts. This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS. After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.  Here is your task:  Task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer.

Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it.

Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       List of facts that you know: ``` ### 1.

             [SYSTEM]: You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can. To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code. To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.  Here are a few examples using notional tools: --- Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."  Thought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer. Code: ```py answer = document_qa(document=document, question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?") print(answer) ```<end_code> Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."  Thought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person. Code: ```py image = image_generator("A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.") final_answer(image) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"  Thought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool Code: ```py result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678 final_answer(result) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French. You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code: {'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}"  Thought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image. Code: ```py translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English") print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.") answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question) final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}") ```<end_code>  --- Task: In a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer. What does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?  Thought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: No result found for query "1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein".  Thought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: Found 6 pages: [Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)  [Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)  (truncated)  Thought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more. Code: ```py for url in ["https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/", "https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/"]:     whole_page = visit_webpage(url)     print(whole_page)     print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")  # Print separator between pages ```<end_code> Observation: Manhattan Project Locations: Los Alamos, NM Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at (truncated)  Thought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: "He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity." Let's answer in one word. Code: ```py final_answer("diminished") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?"  Thought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities. Code: ```py for city in ["Guangzhou", "Shanghai"]:     print(f"Population {city}:", search(f"{city} population") ```<end_code> Observation: Population Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'] Population Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'  Thought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population. Code: ```py final_answer("Shanghai") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?"  Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search. Code: ```py pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki) pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search) ```<end_code> Observation: Pope age: "The pope Francis is currently 88 years old."  Thought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code. Code: ```py pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36 final_answer(pope_current_age) ```<end_code>  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools: - visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.     Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [".html", ".htm", ".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.     Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': "The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}     Returns an output of type: string - final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.     Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task: 1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail. 2. Use only variables that you have defined! 3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'. 4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block. 5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters. 6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'. 7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables. 8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['PyPDF2', 'sympy', 'io', 'sklearn', 'chess', 're', 'pandas', 'numpy', 'PIL', 'pydub', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'datetime', 'os', 'pptx', 'pubchempy', 'scipy', 'statistics', 'fractions', 'requests', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'queue', 'random', 'time', 'collections', 'xml', 'Bio', 'torch', 'zipfile', 'bs4', 'math', 'csv', 'json'] 9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist. 10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
             [USER]: New task: You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: Of the cities within the United States where U.S. presidents were born, which two are the farthest apart from the westernmost to the easternmost going east, giving the city names only? Give them to me in alphabetical order, in a comma-separated list
             [ASSISTANT]: [FACTS LIST]: Here are the facts that I know so far: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The task focuses exclusively on cities within the United States that are birthplaces of U.S. presidents.   • The answer must consist of two city names: one corresponding to the far western birthplace and the other corresponding to the far eastern birthplace among those cities.   • The final response should present the two city names in alphabetical order as a comma-separated list.   • It is stated that all relevant tools needed to solve the task are at our disposal, and the correct answer exists.  ### 2. Facts to look up • The complete list of U.S. presidents along with their birth cities. (Potential sources: Wikipedia pages like “List of presidents of the United States” or “Presidential birthplaces”.)   • The geographical coordinates (or relative locations) of each of those birth cities, to determine which cities are the farthest east and west. (Potential sources: Geographical databases such as Google Maps, U.S. Geological Survey data, or other verified geographic information sites.)   • Verification sources that confirm the birth locations and their coordinates to ensure accuracy. (For instance, presidential library websites or authoritative history reference books.)  ### 3. Facts to derive • Determine, from the looked-up birth cities and their geographic coordinates, which city is the farthest west among those birthplaces.   • Determine, from the looked-up birth cities and their geographic coordinates, which city is the farthest east among those birthplaces.   • From the above derivations, form the final answer by listing these two cities in alphabetical order, using a comma to separate them. ```
             [ASSISTANT]: [PLAN]: Here is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task: ``` 1. Retrieve a complete list of U.S. presidents along with their birth cities from reliable historical sources. 2. Filter the list to include only those birth cities that are within the United States. 3. For each identified city, obtain its geographical coordinates (longitude values) from verified geographic data sources. 4. Identify the city with the smallest (most negative) longitude value as the farthest west. 5. Identify the city with the largest (most positive) longitude value as the farthest east. 6. Confirm that these two birth cities are correct by cross-checking multiple reliable sources. 7. Output the names of these two cities in alphabetical order, separated by a comma.  ```
             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: To solve this task, I must first determine the set of U.S. presidents’ birthplaces that are cities within the United States. I then need to determine which of these cities is located farthest west and which is farthest east (i.e. having the smallest and largest longitude respective to a − sign, since U.S. cities lie west of the prime meridian). A well‐known fact is that Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, which is in the extreme west (longitude ≃ 157°W). On the eastern side among presidential birthplaces, one can note that both John Adams and John Quincy Adams were born in the Massachusetts area – specifically in Quincy, Massachusetts (with longitude roughly −71°W), which is the closest to the prime meridian among those cities. (Many other presidents were born in locations that are more inland or further west than Quincy.) Therefore, the two cities from the extreme ends are Honolulu and Quincy. Finally, the answer must be submitted as an alphabetical, comma‐separated list. Alphabetically, “Honolulu” comes before “Quincy.”  Code: ```py # Final answer prepared as requested. final_answer("Honolulu, Quincy") ```
