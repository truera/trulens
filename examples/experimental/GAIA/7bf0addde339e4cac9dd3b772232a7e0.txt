           [USER]: Below I will present you a task.  You will now build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need. To do so, you will have to read the task and identify things that must be discovered in order to successfully complete it. Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Here is how you will structure this survey:  --- ### 1. Facts given in the task List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).  ### 2. Facts to look up List here any facts that we may need to look up. Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.  ### 3. Facts to derive List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.  Keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings: ### 1. Facts given in the task ### 2. Facts to look up ### 3. Facts to derive Do not add anything else.  Here is the task: ``` You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)  I've got a Boggle board here:  ABRL EITE IONS FPEI  I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game. ``` Now begin!
           [ASSISTANT]: ### 1. Facts given in the task • The Boggle board configuration is provided as four rows:     Row 1: A B R L     Row 2: E I T E     Row 3: I O N S     Row 4: F P E I   • The objective is to find the longest English word that can be formed by navigating the board following Boggle rules (i.e., using adjacent letters without reusing the same cell in a single word). • If there are multiple words with the maximum length, the tie should be broken by choosing the word that comes first alphabetically. • The dictionary to be used is the "words_alpha" list available at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.  ### 2. Facts to look up • The exact contents of the words_alpha dictionary file, including its complete list of acceptable English words.     Source: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (specifically, the file named "words_alpha.txt" if available). • The precise rules for letter adjacency (including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors) as they pertain to Boggle, to ensure accurate path generation.     Source: Standard Boggle rules documentation or references. • Any special considerations regarding letter repetition: clarification that each cell in the Boggle grid may not be reused within a single word.  ### 3. Facts to derive • The structure of the Boggle board in terms of cell coordinates (e.g., assigning each letter a coordinate for systematic path exploration). • All valid paths or sequences on the board that correspond to words in the words_alpha dictionary, following the Boggle traversal rules. • The length of each valid word generated from the board.     Process: Derive word lengths by comparing potential paths with dictionary entries. • The longest word (or words, if there’s a tie) from the set of valid words.     Process: Compute the maximum length and filter candidate words. • The correct tie-breaking word (i.e., alphabetically first among the longest words) if more than one longest word exists. • Verification that the final chosen word is correct by re-checking that it can be navigated on the board and that it exists in the words_alpha dictionary.

           [USER]: You are a world expert at making efficient plans to solve any task using a set of carefully crafted tools.  Now for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts. This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS. After writing the final step of the plan, write the '\n<end_plan>' tag and stop there.

Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search!

Write your plan below.
           [ASSISTANT]: 1. Load the contents of the words_alpha dictionary from the GitHub repository and parse it into a usable list of English words. 2. Represent the Boggle board as a 4×4 grid with each cell identified by its row and column coordinates. 3. Define the rules for letter adjacency as per Boggle (neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) and set the constraint that no cell can be reused in a single word path. 4. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that, starting from each cell of the grid, constructs all possible letter sequences by exploring valid adjacent cells. 5. During the DFS search, use an efficient method to check whether the current letter sequence is a prefix of any word in the dictionary (to allow early pruning) and if it forms a complete word in the dictionary. 6. Accumulate all valid words found during the search that are present in the words_alpha dictionary. 7. Identify the longest word (or words) among the valid words, then select the alphabetically first word in case of a tie. 8. Verify that the selected word can indeed be traced on the board following Boggle rules and is present in the dictionary. 9. Provide the verified longest word as the final answer.

             [SYSTEM]: You are an expert assistant who can solve any task using code blobs. You will be given a task to solve as best you can. To do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code. To solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.  At each step, in the 'Thought:' sequence, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use. Then in the 'Code:' sequence, you should write the code in simple Python. The code sequence must end with '<end_code>' sequence. During each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need. These print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step. In the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool.  Here are a few examples using notional tools: --- Task: "Generate an image of the oldest person in this document."  Thought: I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer. Code: ```py answer = document_qa(document=document, question="Who is the oldest person mentioned?") print(answer) ```<end_code> Observation: "The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland."  Thought: I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person. Code: ```py image = image_generator("A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.") final_answer(image) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?"  Thought: I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool Code: ```py result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678 final_answer(result) ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Answer the question in the variable `question` about the image stored in the variable `image`. The question is in French. You have been provided with these additional arguments, that you can access using the keys as variables in your python code: {'question': 'Quel est l'animal sur l'image?', 'image': 'path/to/image.jpg'}"  Thought: I will use the following tools: `translator` to translate the question into English and then `image_qa` to answer the question on the input image. Code: ```py translated_question = translator(question=question, src_lang="French", tgt_lang="English") print(f"The translated question is {translated_question}.") answer = image_qa(image=image, question=translated_question) final_answer(f"The answer is {answer}") ```<end_code>  --- Task: In a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer. What does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?  Thought: I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: No result found for query "1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein".  Thought: The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query. Code: ```py pages = search(query="1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam") print(pages) ```<end_code> Observation: Found 6 pages: [Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)  [Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)  (truncated)  Thought: I will read the first 2 pages to know more. Code: ```py for url in ["https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/", "https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/"]:     whole_page = visit_webpage(url)     print(whole_page)     print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")  # Print separator between pages ```<end_code> Observation: Manhattan Project Locations: Los Alamos, NM Stanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at (truncated)  Thought: I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: "He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity." Let's answer in one word. Code: ```py final_answer("diminished") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?"  Thought: I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `search` to get the population of both cities. Code: ```py for city in ["Guangzhou", "Shanghai"]:     print(f"Population {city}:", search(f"{city} population") ```<end_code> Observation: Population Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.'] Population Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'  Thought: Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population. Code: ```py final_answer("Shanghai") ```<end_code>  --- Task: "What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?"  Thought: I will use the tool `wiki` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search. Code: ```py pope_age_wiki = wiki(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per wikipedia:", pope_age_wiki) pope_age_search = web_search(query="current pope age") print("Pope age as per google search:", pope_age_search) ```<end_code> Observation: Pope age: "The pope Francis is currently 88 years old."  Thought: I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code. Code: ```py pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36 final_answer(pope_current_age) ```<end_code>  Above example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools: - visualizer: A tool that can answer questions about attached images.     Takes inputs: {'image_path': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The path to the image on which to answer the question. This should be a local path to downloaded image.'}, 'question': {'type': 'string', 'nullable': True, 'description': 'The question to answer.'}}     Returns an output of type: string - inspect_file_as_text:  You cannot load files yourself: instead call this tool to read a file as markdown text and ask questions about it. This tool handles the following file extensions: [".html", ".htm", ".xlsx", ".pptx", ".wav", ".mp3", ".m4a", ".flac", ".pdf", ".docx"], and all other types of text files. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.     Takes inputs: {'file_path': {'description': "The path to the file you want to read as text. Must be a '.something' file, like '.pdf'. If it is an image, use the visualizer tool instead! DO NOT use this tool for an HTML webpage: use the web_search tool instead!", 'type': 'string'}, 'question': {'description': '[Optional]: Your question, as a natural language sentence. Provide as much context as possible. Do not pass this parameter if you just want to directly return the content of the file.', 'type': 'string', 'nullable': True}}     Returns an output of type: string - final_answer: Provides a final answer to the given problem.     Takes inputs: {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}     Returns an output of type: any You can also give tasks to team members. Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task. Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task. Here is a list of the team members that you can call: - search_agent: A team member that will search the internet to answer your question.     Ask him for all your questions that require browsing the web.     Provide him as much context as possible, in particular if you need to search on a specific timeframe!     And don't hesitate to provide him with a complex search task, like finding a difference between two webpages.     Your request must be a real sentence, not a google search! Like "Find me this information (...)" rather than a few keywords.       Here are the rules you should always follow to solve your task: 1. Always provide a 'Thought:' sequence, and a 'Code:\n```py' sequence ending with '```<end_code>' sequence, else you will fail. 2. Use only variables that you have defined! 3. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wiki({'query': "What is the place where James Bond lives?"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wiki(query="What is the place where James Bond lives?")'. 4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block. 5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters. 6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'. 7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables. 8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['chess', 'statistics', 'os', 'datetime', 'fractions', 'queue', 'requests', 'pydub', 'pandas', 'sympy', 'zipfile', 'time', 'unicodedata', 'stat', 'torch', 'pubchempy', 'io', 'PyPDF2', 'random', 'Bio', 'itertools', 'yahoo_finance', 'numpy', 'math', 'bs4', 'collections', 'json', 'sklearn', 'pptx', 'xml', 're', 'PIL', 'scipy', 'csv'] 9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist. 10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.  Now Begin! If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
             [USER]: New task: You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)  I've got a Boggle board here:  ABRL EITE IONS FPEI  I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.
             [ASSISTANT]: [FACTS LIST]: Here are the facts that I know so far: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The Boggle board configuration is provided as four rows:     Row 1: A B R L     Row 2: E I T E     Row 3: I O N S     Row 4: F P E I   • The objective is to find the longest English word that can be formed by navigating the board following Boggle rules (i.e., using adjacent letters without reusing the same cell in a single word). • If there are multiple words with the maximum length, the tie should be broken by choosing the word that comes first alphabetically. • The dictionary to be used is the "words_alpha" list available at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.  ### 2. Facts to look up • The exact contents of the words_alpha dictionary file, including its complete list of acceptable English words.     Source: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (specifically, the file named "words_alpha.txt" if available). • The precise rules for letter adjacency (including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors) as they pertain to Boggle, to ensure accurate path generation.     Source: Standard Boggle rules documentation or references. • Any special considerations regarding letter repetition: clarification that each cell in the Boggle grid may not be reused within a single word.  ### 3. Facts to derive • The structure of the Boggle board in terms of cell coordinates (e.g., assigning each letter a coordinate for systematic path exploration). • All valid paths or sequences on the board that correspond to words in the words_alpha dictionary, following the Boggle traversal rules. • The length of each valid word generated from the board.     Process: Derive word lengths by comparing potential paths with dictionary entries. • The longest word (or words, if there’s a tie) from the set of valid words.     Process: Compute the maximum length and filter candidate words. • The correct tie-breaking word (i.e., alphabetically first among the longest words) if more than one longest word exists. • Verification that the final chosen word is correct by re-checking that it can be navigated on the board and that it exists in the words_alpha dictionary. ```
             [ASSISTANT]: [PLAN]: Here is the plan of action that I will follow to solve the task: ``` 1. Load the contents of the words_alpha dictionary from the GitHub repository and parse it into a usable list of English words. 2. Represent the Boggle board as a 4×4 grid with each cell identified by its row and column coordinates. 3. Define the rules for letter adjacency as per Boggle (neighbors horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) and set the constraint that no cell can be reused in a single word path. 4. Implement a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm that, starting from each cell of the grid, constructs all possible letter sequences by exploring valid adjacent cells. 5. During the DFS search, use an efficient method to check whether the current letter sequence is a prefix of any word in the dictionary (to allow early pruning) and if it forms a complete word in the dictionary. 6.

Verify that the selected word can indeed be traced on the board following Boggle rules and is present in the dictionary. 9. Provide the verified longest word as the final answer.   ```
             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: I will load the "words_alpha.txt" dictionary using the inspect_file_as_text tool (which reads .txt files), then build a prefix tree (trie) from it to enable fast prefix filtering while doing DFS on the 4×4 Boggle board. I will model the board as a list of lists:    [["A","B","R","L"],    ["E","I","T","E"],    ["I","O","N","S"],    ["F","P","E","I"]]  I will then run a DFS from every cell, moving along all eight adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally), and keep track of visited cells. At each step I append the letter in the cell to the current word and check if the current sequence is a prefix in the trie. If it is not, I prune that path.

If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach.
             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: The previous approach using inspect_file_as_text failed since the local file "words_alpha.txt" was not available. Instead, I'll switch to downloading the dictionary file directly from its raw URL using the requests module. Since the maximum possible path is 16 letters (a 4×4 board), I'll filter the word list to only include words with length ≤ 16. Then I'll build a trie (prefix tree) over these words for fast prefix checking during DFS. I'll represent the Boggle board as a 4×4 grid and run a DFS from every cell (moving in all 8 adjacent directions) without revisiting a cell in the same path. As I traverse, I’ll check if the current path is a prefix in the trie and if it forms a complete word (adding it to our result). Finally, I will find the longest word among the found words and, in case of ties, choose the alphabetically first one. I then return the answer with final_answer.

Maybe there is an infinite loop somewhere in the code, or you're just asking too many calculations. Now let's retry: take care not to repeat previous errors! If you have retried several times, try a completely different approach.
             [ASSISTANT]: Thought: The previous DFS-on-board approach using a trie and exploring all board paths proved too computationally expensive. Instead, I now plan to iterate over candidate words from the dictionary (restricted to those of length 16 or fewer) and check if they can be found on the board. We will use two optimizations:  1. Pre‐filter each candidate word by comparing its letter frequency with that of the board. In Boggle each cell can be used only once, so if any letter appears more times in the word than on the board, we can immediately discard the candidate.  2. We will sort the candidate words in descending order of length (and for words of equal length, in alphabetical order) so that the first candidate found that can be formed on the board is our answer.  The plan:  • Download the dictionary file from the raw URL. • Restrict the candidate words to those with length ≤ 16. • Compute the board’s letter frequency. • Sort the candidate words by (-len(word), word). • For each candidate, if its frequency is “feasible,” then for any board cell that matches its first letter, try a DFS to see if the candidate can be traced along adjacent cells (neighbors in all eight directions) without reusing a cell. • When we find a candidate that works, we return it as our final answer.  I now proceed with the code.  Code: ```py import requests from collections import Counter  # Download the words_alpha.txt file from the raw GitHub URL. url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt" response = requests.get(url) all_words = response.text.splitlines()  # Restrict to words of length <= 16 (the board has 16 cells maximum) candidates = [w for w in all_words if len(w) <= 16]  # Compute board and its letter frequency. board = [     ["A", "B", "R", "L"],     ["E", "I", "T", "E"],     ["I", "O", "N", "S"],     ["F", "P", "E", "I"] ] ROWS = len(board) COLS = len(board[0])  # Prepare board frequency (all letters lower-case) board_letters = [cell.lower() for row in board for cell in row] board_freq = Counter(board_letters)  # Function to check if candidate word letter frequency is feasible. def is_feasible(word):     word_freq = Counter(word)     for letter, count in word_freq.items():         if count > board_freq.get(letter, 0):             return False     return True  # Define DFS search to see if word can be formed from board following Boggle rules. def exists_on_board(word):     # DFS function: index tracks current position in word; (r, c) is current cell.     def dfs(index, r, c, visited):         if index == len(word):             return True         # explore neighbors in 8 directions.         for dr in [-1,0,1]:             for dc in [-1,0,1]:                 if dr==0 and dc==0:                     continue                 nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc                 if 0<=nr<ROWS and 0<=nc<COLS and (nr, nc) not in visited:                     if board[nr][nc].lower() == word[index]:                         visited.add((nr, nc))                         if dfs(index+1, nr, nc, visited):                             return True                         visited.remove((nr, nc))         return False      # try starting from every cell that matches the first letter.     for r in range(ROWS):         for c in range(COLS):             if board[r][c].lower() == word[0]:                 visited = {(r,c)}                 if dfs(1, r, c, visited):                     return True     return False  # Sort candidates by descending length, and for equal length, alphabetically ascending. candidates.sort(key=lambda w: (-len(w), w))  # Traverse the candidate list, first checking feasibility then trying DFS. for word in candidates:     word_lower = word.lower()     if not is_feasible(word_lower):         continue     if exists_on_board(word_lower):         final_answer(word_lower)         break ```

         [USER]: [FACTS LIST]: Here are the facts that I know so far: ``` ### 1. Facts given in the task • The Boggle board configuration is provided as four rows:     Row 1: A B R L     Row 2: E I T E     Row 3: I O N S     Row 4: F P E I   • The objective is to find the longest English word that can be formed by navigating the board following Boggle rules (i.e., using adjacent letters without reusing the same cell in a single word). • If there are multiple words with the maximum length, the tie should be broken by choosing the word that comes first alphabetically. • The dictionary to be used is the "words_alpha" list available at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words.  ### 2. Facts to look up • The exact contents of the words_alpha dictionary file, including its complete list of acceptable English words.     Source: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words (specifically, the file named "words_alpha.txt" if available). • The precise rules for letter adjacency (including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal neighbors) as they pertain to Boggle, to ensure accurate path generation.     Source: Standard Boggle rules documentation or references. • Any special considerations regarding letter repetition: clarification that each cell in the Boggle grid may not be reused within a single word.  ### 3. Facts to derive • The structure of the Boggle board in terms of cell coordinates (e.g., assigning each letter a coordinate for systematic path exploration). • All valid paths or sequences on the board that correspond to words in the words_alpha dictionary, following the Boggle traversal rules. • The length of each valid word generated from the board.     Process: Derive word lengths by comparing potential paths with dictionary entries. • The longest word (or words, if there’s a tie) from the set of valid words.     Process: Compute the maximum length and filter candidate words. • The correct tie-breaking word (i.e., alphabetically first among the longest words) if more than one longest word exists. • Verification that the final chosen word is correct by re-checking that it can be navigated on the board and that it exists in the words_alpha dictionary. ```

         [USER]:  Read the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question. The question is repeated here for convenience:  You have one question to answer. It is paramount that you provide a correct answer. Give it all you can: I know for a fact that you have access to all the relevant tools to solve it and find the correct answer (the answer does exist). Failure or 'I cannot answer' or 'None found' will not be tolerated, success will be rewarded. Run verification steps if that's needed, you must make sure you find the correct answer! Here is the task: I thought we could try a fun word puzzle together :)  I've got a Boggle board here:  ABRL EITE IONS FPEI  I'd like to know the longest word that can be generated from the board. Please find the longest English language word that can be generated from this board. If more than one word of the same length exists at the maximum word length, please report the longest word that comes first, alphabetically. Oh, and I know that there might be different wordlists available for Boggle, so let's please just use the words_alpha dictionary found at https://github.com/dwyl/english-words as the dictionary for our game.  To output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER] Your FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings. ADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.) If you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise. If you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'. If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings. If you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'
