Through these openings the tears pass into the lacrimal canaliculus, then through the lacrimal sac into the nasolacrimal duct and finally into the nasal cavity.",

                        "Why Lifting Heavy is the Key to Weight Loss. You know that losing fat involves increasing your metabolism. What you may not know is that muscle plays a huge role in raising metabolism. A pound of muscle burns about 10-20 calories a day while a pound of fat burns 5 calories. That means any growth in your muscle tissue is going to help you burn more calories all day long. Increases resting metabolic rate so you burn more calories, even while at rest.",
                        "When losing weight, you will lose some muscle mass along with body fat. If you don't perform resistance training regularly, up to 30% of the weight you lose can come from muscle tissue, which doesn't do your health, fitness or metabolism any favors in the long run.",
                        "3/13/2014 5:00 AM3/13/2014 5:00 AM : 16 comments : 760,754 Views. If you are concerned about how many calories you burn during strength training, chances are that you are actively trying to lose weight (or might want to ensure you are eating enough to support strength training without losing additional weight).",
                        "Typically, if you lift 60%-80% of max, you could do anywhere from 10-20 reps. Lifting at 80% and above takes you down to the lower rep range, which is where you'll be if you're trying to gain size. That means keeping your reps somewhere between 8-16, if you're lifting for weight loss and fitness. Your weights are determined by the number of reps you're doing. Choose a weight you can only lift 16 times. This is hit or miss, so you're experimenting.",
                        "The calories burned while weight lifting will depend on your gender, weight, height, age, and the intensity of weight lifting. For example, if you are female, weigh 150 pounds (68kg), are 5 feet 4 inches tall, and are age 45, you will burn about 3 calories per minute, or 174 calories per hour during light weight lifting. There are a few formulas you can use to calculate how many calories you would burn during any physical activity. One of the formulas is: Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) x Metabolic equivalent of task (MET) Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR is the amount of calories you burn while resting, every 24 hours.",
                        "Although strength training is challenging and requires a lot of hard work (especially when lifting heavy weights), it doesn't typically burn as many calories as cardiovascular (aerobic) exercises like running or cycling.",
                        "The problem is that most of us don't think much about how much weight we need, much less going through the process of figuring out 1 rep max for every exercise we're doing. In fact, I see many gym-goers lifting the same weights week after week, which is just one way to keep your body from changing.",
                        "MET for weight lifting is about 3 for light weight lifting, and about 6 for heavy weight lifting. So, the above example given will look like this: BMR: 655 + (4.35 x 150) + (4.7 x 64) – (4.7 x 45) = 1397 calories per 24 hours, 58 calories per hour. MET: 3.0.",
                        "You burn calories while doing work. Lifting weights is work. The longer you lift and to some extent, the more you lift, the more calories you will burn. You can see from this chart, that for most men, weight training will consume 300 - 500 Kcal/hour while running will consume 500 - 1300 Kcal/hr.",
                        "Gaining 30 pounds of muscle increases your RMR by 180 calories (average 6 calories per pound per day). While this might not seem large, at the end of the week that's 1260 calories which is the equivalent of two *hard* one hour workouts or a 1/3 pound of fat."

The outer membrane covers the organelle and contains it like a skin. The inner membrane folds over many times and creates layered structures called cristae. The fluid contained in the mitochondria is called the matrix. The folding of the inner membrane increases the surface area inside the organelle. Since many of the chemical reactions happen on the inner membrane, the increased surface area creates more space for reactions to occur.",

If you are very active and use your arms for overhead work or sports, your doctor may also suggest surgery.",

                        "When Australian scientist Ruben Meerman lost 30 pounds last year, one question kept bugging him: Where did the fat go? The answer might seem obvious: It was burned up, as we say — which implies that it was transformed into heat or energy.",
                        "The researchers chose to follow the path of these atoms when leaving the body. They found that when 10 kg of fat were oxidized, 8.4 kg were converted and excreted as carbon dioxide (CO2) via the lungs, and 1.6 kg became water (H20). In order for 10 kg of human fat to be oxidized, the researchers calculated that 29 kg of oxygen must be inhaled.",
                        "Exercise also increases the oxidation of fat, which then leaves your body via your lungs, in the form of carbon dioxide, and your bodily fluids, in the form of water. What’s not so complex however, is how to optimize your metabolism—even if you don’t understand the exact mechanisms involved.",
                        "The research conducted by a team at UNSW Science in Sydney calculated exactly what happens to our fat when we shed kilos, and revealed that doctor's leading theories are wrong - we don’t convert our missing mass into heat or energy, we breathe it out.",
                        "If you eat less than you exhale, you’ll lose weight. If you’re trying to shed pounds, don’t worry too much about all of this talk of carbon atoms and oxidation. Balancing the calories you eat with the calories you expend is a sound strategy. In fact, it’s what Meerman did when he trimmed down last year. “I was drinking three cappuccinos made with full cream milk each day, and I’d hit 40 years of age,” he says. “Your metabolism slows a bit as you get older so you can’t consume as many calories and expect to stay slim.",
                        "1 When you lose weight, you exhale 84 percent of the lost fat in the form of carbon dioxide. The remaining 16 percent is excreted as water via bodily fluids.  By substituting one hour of sedentary lounging with one hour of moderate exercise—to increase your respiratory rate—your metabolic rate is increased sevenfold.",
                        "Breathe deeply, Australian research shows that it’s going to take a lot of exhaling to get rid of that excess fat. FIONA MACDONALD. 17 DEC 2014. Despite society’s obsession with weight loss, a study has revealed that, surprisingly, most health professionals don’t actually know what happens to fat when we “lose it”.",
                        "Consider intermittent fasting: If you’re insulin/leptin resistant and/or are overweight, boost your body's fat-burning potential by incorporating intermittent fasting. This is one of the most powerful approaches to reverse insulin resistance. It is only necessary to do until your insulin resistance resolves.",

                        "To lose weight, you need to break down those triglycerides to access their carbon. The results showed that in order to completely breakdown 10kg of human fat, we need to inhale 29 kg of oxygen (and somewhere along the way, burn 94,000 calories). This reaction produces 28 kg of CO2 and 11 kg of water."

                        "Unlike the wheel brakes you have on your car, the Jacobs Engine Brake (TM) is a compression release engine brake used by large diesel trucks, especially on steep downgrades. To understand how it works, remember that a diesel engine has much higher compression than a gasoline engine, typically 15:1.",
                        "The Jake Brake is a compression brake also know as a diesel engine retarder and Jacob F's answer above is absolutely correct. The reason I know this is that in the mid 1970's I was the manager of the department at Jacobs that assembled and tested the Jake Brakes. The Jake Brake is not an exhaust brake.",
                        "The jake brake slightly opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near top dead center (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses the air in the cylinder to 1/15th its original volume. This creates a lot of drag on the engine.",
                        "A Jake Brake is an engine brake, also known as a compression brake, which is used to slow down a large vehicle. Diesel engines have greater compression than typical gasoline powered engines, and that compression is used by the Jake Brake to help slow the engine.",
                        "In short, the jake brake turns a power-producing engine into a power-absorbing air compressor, thus slowing the truck. The brake sits in a box over the engine. The trucker has a switch in the cab where she can choose how many cylinders to cut out; the more cylinders, the more powerful the slowing of the truck.",

The Jake Brake opens the exhaust valves when the piston is near top dead center (where ignition normally occurs). On the upstroke, the piston compresses the air in the cylinder to 1/15th its original volume, which creates drag on the engine. The Jacobs Engine Brake then releases the compressed air and the energy stored in it before it can push back on the piston during the down stroke. The Jake Brake turns a power producing engine into a power absorbing air compressor and in turn, causes the truck to slow down."

                        "As the plates move across the Earth's surface, they interact with one another at plate boundaries, which are places where earthquakes and volcanoes are common. Typically, plate boundaries are also places of great mineral wealth.",
                        "Convergent boundaries are boundaries where tectonic plates are moving together. Since the edges of both can't be in the same place, one plate will be forced under another plate (and the other above). The plate going 'down' will thus go deeper into the earth - allowing deeper earthquakes to occur.",
                        "Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults, but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its focus or hypocenter. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.",
                        "Global plate tectonic movement. An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.",
                        "Black dots mark the epicentres of all earthquakes recorded from 1964 to 1999. The most intense earthquake activity is where subduction is taking place, but there is some earthquake activity along the mid-ocean ridges and above mantle ‘hot-spots’.",
                        "Earthquakes are common at subduction zones, points where one plate moves below another. 1  Earthquakes are common at subductions zones, points where the Earth's plates meet and one plate moves below the other. The powerful earthquakes that are caused by this type of plate movement are known as megathrust earthquakes.",
                        "Most earthquakes occur on plate boundaries for a variety of reasons. When plates in the earth's crust move, they scrape or bump each other on the edges and boundaries. Therefo…re, the movements of the plates are more likely to be felt along the edges, where all of the activity takes place.",
                        "Earth's outer layer, the crust, is divided into a set of large moving plates. The lines where they meet are called plate boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundary: divergent, convergent and transform. Plates move away from one another at divergent boundaries.",
                        "Earthquakes at a Plate Boundary. An earthquake is a sudden motion or trembling in the crust caused by the abrupt release of accumulated stress along a fault, a break in the Earth’s crust. The ‘Ring of Fire’ shows the position of the New Zealand continent within a zone of intense seismic activity around the Pacific Ocean.",
                        "Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates. And i think Most earthquakes occur along the edge of the oceanic and continental plates. The earth's crust (the ou…ter layer of the planet) is made up of several pieces, called plates."

                        "What are Outriggers Used For? Mainly used in deep sea trolling, outriggers are a pair of long poles fitted on both sides of a boat that holds fishing lines away from the boat.It is usually made of fiberglass and aluminum, and is tilted at an angle between 70 to 80 degrees.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.",
                        "When being used, outriggers are lowered to an angle nearly the same level as the water’s surface. At the edge of each outrigger is a pulley with a cord, attached to which is a quick release clip that holds the fishing line.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.",
                        "In an outrigger canoe and in sailboats such as the proa, an outrigger is a thin, long, solid, hull used to stabilise an inherently unstable main hull.The outrigger is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull is less likely to capsize.If only one outrigger is used on a vessel, its weight reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its buoyancy reduces the tendency in the other direction.ooden outriggers appear on the new Trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300 while Harry Clasper (1812–1870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern metal version.",

                        "Outriggers also hold the fishing lines at a distance from both sides of the boat, spreading the lines far enough to prevent the risk of tangling. With more lines in the water, the angler can set them at different distances and depths that can create a variety of natural patterns to increase the chances of a strike.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.",
                        "The outrigger float is called the ama in many Polynesian and Micronesian languages. The spars connecting the ama to the main hull (or the two hulls in a double-hull canoe) are called ʻiako in Hawaiian and kiato in Māori (with similar words in other Polynesian languages); in Micronesian languages, the term aka is used.n an outrigger canoe the paddlers sit in line, facing toward the bow of the canoe (i.e. forward, in the direction of travel, unlike rowing). The seats are numbered from 1 (closest to the bow) to the number of seats in the canoe, usually 6.",
                        "Outriggers telescope out away from a fishing boat to be able to drop fishing bait lines up to several feet away from the boat into the water.
