      "In this paper, we present QII, a general family of metrics\n",

      "between inputs to allow causal reasoning, and computes the\n",
      "marginal inﬂuence of inputs in situations where inputs cannot\n",
      "affect outcomes alone. Also, we demonstrate that QII can\n",
      "be efﬁciently approximated, and can be made differentially\n",

      "An immediate next step in this line of work is to explore\n",
      "adoption strategies in the many areas that use personal infor-\n",

      "which includes a choice for our game-theoretic power index.\n",
