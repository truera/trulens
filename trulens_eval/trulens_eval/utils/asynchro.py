# Synchronization/Async Utilities

NOTE: we cannot name a module "async" as it is a python keyword.

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

Some functions in trulens_eval come with asynchronous versions. Those use "async
def" instead of "def" and typically start with the letter "a" in their name with
the rest matching their synchronous version.

Due to how python handles such functions and how they are executed, it is
relatively difficult to reshare code between the two versions. Asynchronous
functions are executed by an async loop (see
[EventLoop](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html)). Python
prevents any threads from having more than one running loop meaning one may not
be able to create one to run some async code if one has already been
created/running in the thread. The method `sync` here, used to convert an async
computation into a sync computation, needs to create a new thread. The impact of
this, whether overhead, or record info, is uncertain.

### What should be Sync/Async?

Try to have all internals be async but for users we may expose sync versions via
the `sync` method. If internals are async and don't need exposure, don't need to
provide a synced version.
