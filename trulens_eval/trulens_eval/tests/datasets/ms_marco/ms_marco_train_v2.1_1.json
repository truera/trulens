It is best accomplished through cooperative processes that include all stakeholders. This can lead to transformation of people, relationships and communities. Practices and programs reflecting restorative purposes will respond to crime by: 1  identifying and taking steps to repair harm, 2  involving all stakeholders, and. 3  transforming the traditional relationship between communities and their governments in responding to crime.",

            "In an effort to better understand how children form memories, the researchers asked 140 kids between the ages of 4 and 13 to describe their earliest memories and then asked them to do the same thing two years later.",
            "Conversely, a third of the children who were age 10 to 13 during the first interview described the same earliest memory during the second interview. More than half of the memories they recalled were the same at both interviews. The researchers are now studying why children remember certain events and not others.",
            "However, when the offset of childhood amnesia is defined as the age at which the majority of memories are personal recollections rather than known events, then offset occurs at approximately 4.5 years old.",
            "The development of memory in children becomes evident within the first 2 to 3 years of a child's life as they show considerable advances in declarative memory. This enhancement continues into adolescence with major developments in short term memory, working memory, long term memory and autobiographical memory.",
            "Most adults remember little before their third or fourth birthdays, and the thinking has been that prior to this age children do not have the cognitive or language skills to process and store events as memories.",
            "The way that researchers study the memory capabilities of infants in this age range is through measuring eye movements between test images presented. After doing this initial round of testing, the researchers would conduct follow-up tests both 5 minutes later and one day later.",
            "As this happens, memories occurring in the preschool years tend to be lost. \u201cAs young children get older their first memories tend to get later and later, but around age 10 their memories crystallize,\u201d Peterson tells WebMD.",
            "Childhood amnesia, also called infantile amnesia, is the inability of adults to retrieve episodic memories before the age of 2\u20134 years, as well as the period before age 10 of which adults retain fewer memories than might otherwise be expected given the passage of time.",
            "In children under the age of 4, the memory storage capacity limitation constrains complex comprehension processes. As the child grows older however, less processing is necessary which opens more storage space for memory.",
            "Recent research on the development of memory has indicated that declarative, or explicit memory, may exist in infants who are even younger than two years old. For example, newborns who are less than 3 days old demonstrate a preference for their mother\u2019s own voice."

            "Use the tip of the brush to reach behind each front tooth on the top and bottom. In addition, don't forget flossing - it's just as important as brushing. If you don't brush your teeth long enough, you may not be getting your teeth clean enough. If you leave behind bacteria on the teeth after brushing, it can lead to serious problems such as gingivitis or periodontitis.",

            "In addition to having sensory properties, a cat's whiskers are also a good indicator of his mood. When a cat is angry or feels defensive, the whiskers will be pulled back. Otherwise, when the cat is happy, curious or content, the whiskers will be more relaxed and pushed forward. But the whisker's primary use is to help a cat judge whether or not he'll fit through an opening. A cat's whiskers are roughly as wide as his body -- sort of a natural ruler. The whisker tips are sensitive to pressure. You'll probably see a cat stick his head in and out of an opening before he puts his body in. He's judging the width of the opening, and is determining if he can fit into it.",

Fact: Cats use their whiskers as \u201cfeelers\u201d but not to maintain their balance.

Technically, they aren\u2019t whiskers \u2013 they\u2019re called vibrissae, which comes from a Latin word \u201cvibrio\u201d that means to vibrate. A dog\u2019s whiskers are actually highly tuned, multi-functional, sensitive sensory hairs they need and use every day to perform specific functions that help them move around in their world. Dog whiskers are found on both sides of their muzzle, as well as on the forehead above the eyes, on their chin and above the upper lip.",
            "Whiskers are rooted very deep in the cat's face, in an area rich in nerves and blood vessels. In addition to having the long tactile hairs on their cheeks, cats also have shorter ones above their eyebrows, on their chin and on the back of their front legs.",
            "As puppies grow, the whiskers are among the first hairs to develop. Unlike the neatly arranged 12 whiskers in four rows on each side of a cat\u2019s face, dog whiskers are more varied in their pattern depending on their breed and genetics. Whiskers are twice as thick and coarser than regular dog hair.",
            "Do cats use their whiskers for balance? Yes the whiskers help them balance as well as the tail. All the senses work together to help the cat get around in the dark or tight places.

            "SQL clauses site was designed to help programmers and IT professionals, yet unfamiliar with SQL (Structured Query Language) to learn the language and use it in their everyday work. Our tutorial shows how to put into practice various SQL clauses, SQL commands, SQL statements and SQL operators. If SQL clauses and commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE, JOIN, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, and UNION sound like ancient Greek to you, then you have come to the right place.",
            "WHERE {column or expression} comparison-operator value. Syntax for a WHERE clause with Select statement is: SELECT column_list FROM table-name. WHERE condition; 1  column or expression - Is the column of a table or a expression.  comparison-operator - operators like = < > etc.",
            "So SQL offers a feature called WHERE clause, which we can use to restrict the data that is retrieved. The condition you provide in the WHERE clause filters the rows retrieved from the table and gives you only those rows which you expected to see. WHERE clause can be used along with SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE statements.",
            "When you want to retrieve data from a database, you ask for the data by using Structured Query Language, or SQL. SQL is a computer language that closely resembles English that database programs understand. Knowing SQL is important because every query in Microsoft Access uses SQL.",
            "In the above SQL statement: 1  The SELECT clause specifies one or more columns to be retrieved; to specify multiple columns, use a comma and a space between column names. To retrieve all columns, use the wild card * (an asterisk).  The FROM clause specifies one or more tables to be queried.",
            "SQL is a computer language for working with sets of facts and the relationships between them. Relational database programs, such as Access, use SQL to work with data. Like many computer languages, SQL is an international standard that is recognized by standards bodies such as ISO and ANSI.",
            "The WHERE Clause is used when you want to retrieve specific information from a table excluding other irrelevant data. For example, when you want to see the information about students in class 10th only then you do need the information about the students in other class.",
            "To describe a set of data by using SQL, you write a SELECT statement. A SELECT statement contains a complete description of a set of data that you want to obtain from a database. This includes the following: What tables contain the data. How data from different sources is related.",
            "You can use a different name to refer to a data source in a SELECT statement by using a table alias in your FROM clause. A table alias is a name that you assign to a data source in a query when you use an expression as a data source, or to make the SQL statement easier to type and read.",
            "We have illustrated the SQL clauses and SQL commands usage with simple examples, where appropriate. If you want to learn SQL faster, than it's advisable to re-create the examples given in our SQL tutorial in a real RDBMS environment and play with them."

They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils. There are many different types of triglyceride, with the main division between saturated and unsaturated types. Saturated fats are saturated",

Triglycerides are the main constituents of body fat in humans and other animals, as well as vegetable fat. They are also present in the blood to enable the bidirectional transference of adipose fat and blood glucose from the liver, and are a major component of human skin oils.",
            "For adults, triglyceride test results are categorized as follows: 1  Desirable: Less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) 2  Borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.7-2.2 mmol/L) 3  High: 200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L) 4  Very high: Greater than 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)",
            "Triglycerides. 1  Blood tests for triglycerides are usually part of a lipid profile that is used to help identify an individual's risk of developing heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be needed if there is borderline or high risk.",
            "Testing may be ordered more frequently when people have identified risk factors for heart disease. 1  Some risk factors for heart disease include: 2  Cigarette smoking. 3  Being overweight or obese. 4  Unhealthy diet. 5  Being physically inactive\u2014not getting enough exercise. 6  Age (men 45 years or older or women 55 years or older)",
            "Ranges with anything over 499 are being considered extremely high. But these numbers serve more as just a measurement method. They are used to assess risk. Most people wondering what are triglycerides also want to know what having elevated triglycerides levels can mean for the body. Atherosclerosis is the biggest risk associated with having high triglycerides levels.",
            "Sometimes, this storage comes in the form of excess fat in the midsection. Figuring out just what are triglycerides means understanding where they come from. In most cases, triglycerides are the result of digestion and the body breaking down fats. Sometimes they also are the byproduct of carbohydrates as well. While the fats are not always a bad thing, having triglycerides too high can be and for a multitude of reasons.",
            "What Are Triglycerides Levels and Why Do They Matter? When most people ask what are triglycerides, it is because they associate the word with being bad for the body. In fact, they are incredibly important to many body processes and are considered the main form of fat within the body. The body uses triglycerides for energy, which is a good thing.",

            "Triglycerides are utilized in the body by offering a source of energy to cells that require it. They are a normal component of the blood and are naturally stored in fat deposits. However, when present in excess triglycerides can cause problems in the body and lead to serious diseases."

            "Over time, all areas of an affected tooth, from root to crown, may become involved. Tooth resorption is a common condition, affecting an estimated 20 percent to 60 percent of all cats and close to three-quarters of those five years of age and older.",
            "The unerupted tooth. An unerupted tooth can exert pressure against a neighboring root, to cause resorption similar to that from orthodontic treatment. Typical examples include the forward-leaning lower wisdom tooth which is impacted against the back of the standing second molar and causes damage where the two meet.",
            "In a condition known as a tooth resorption \u2013formerly referred to as feline odontoclastic resorptive lesion (FORL) or cervical line lesion\u2014the dentin in a single tooth (or several simultaneously) erodes and eventually becomes irreparably destroyed.",
            "What Is \u201cTooth Resorption\u201d? Tooth resorption is loss of hard dental tissue, but not from decay. This means that the substance of a tooth is broken down by certain specialised body cells and then absorbed. Resorption thus causes some of a tooth, generally in the root area, to just disappear. In the developing child there is a natural physiological resorption of the roots to allow for the exfoliation, or shedding of the first set of teeth at the appropriate time.",
            "(Redirected from Root resorption) Tooth resorption is a process by which all or part of a tooth structure is lost due to activation of the body's innate capacity to remove mineralized tissue, as mediated via cells such as osteoclasts. Types include external resorption and internal resorption. It can be due to trauma, infection, or hyperplasia.",
            "Within each of a cat\u2019s teeth is a chamber (root canal) that contains tissue made up of blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. This tissue, which communicates with the rest of the animal\u2019s body, is surrounded by a bony substance called dentin, which accounts for the bulk of the tooth\u2019s structure.",
            "The best way of confirming the suspected presence of the condition, she notes, is by means of a full-mouth intra-oral radiograph. If veterinary examination reveals the presence of tooth resorption, Dr. Rawlinson points out, the only effective treatment will entail extraction of any affected teeth.",
            "El-Bialy states that orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption differs from other types of tooth root resorption, and treatment protocol for this type always involves a root canal treatment or extraction of these teeth in severe cases and prosthetic replacement.",
            "Everyday Health indicates that the majority of patients who go through orthodontic therapy do not get root resorption. Everyday Health also explains that many teeth with root resorption still function properly and may last for many years or even a lifetime despite resorption."

            "Question: Will I Know It When My Blood Pressure Goes Up? Answer: High blood pressure, or hypertension, is called the silent killer because it can go undiagnosed for years, damaging the brain, your eyesight, your heart or your kidneys long before symptoms develop.",
            "Request a change in your medications or dosages. Some medications lower your blood pressure as a side effect. Discuss with your doctor whether any of your current medications could be lowering your blood pressure and if a change in your prescription medication regimen could help you raise your low blood pressure.",
            "1 This can lead to a fall in blood pressure upon standing up. During this kind of quick movement your blood vessels may find it hard to adjust.  Neurological conditions: For example, Parkinson\u2019s disease. The drugs that are prescribed to treat Parkinson\u2019s can cause low blood pressure.",
            "Treatment is available, if your doctor feels that there is a cause for your symptoms that can be treated. For example: If your GP suspects that a medicine you are taking is the cause of your low blood pressure, an alternative medicine may be suggested, or the dosage changed.",
            "You can locate this screen inside your sump tank. You will have to remove the oil from your vehicle in the same way that you would to change the oil.

During this kind of quick movement your blood vessels may find it hard to adjust.",
            "Avoid long, hot showers. The hot water from showers and spas can cause your blood vessels to expand, which can lead to a further drop in blood pressure. This can cause dizziness and fainting. You can remedy this by taking warm (rather than hot) showers and avoiding spas or hot tubs.",
            "So visit your doctor, have your blood pressure checked. There are free blood pressure machines at pharmacies and grocery stores. And if the top number is ever over 140 or the bottom number ever over 90, make sure to make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible.",
            "Diagnosing Low Oil Pressure Causes. If you want to know how to fix low oil pressure, the initial place you should start is with your dip stick. Grab a cloth and pull out the dip stick. Give it a wipe and place it back inside. Withdraw it again and see what level of oil appears on the markers. All dip sticks will have two levels of marking."

When the wind whips up a dust storm that stings our eyes, its ability to move sand is very clear. But the most powerful erosive force on the earth is not wind but water, which causes erosion in its solid form of ice and as a liquid. Water in its liquid form causes erosion in many ways.

            "Baking potatoes requires a temperature range between 300 and 400F, depending upon the type of oven you use. Medium size potatoes will have to be baked for 45 minutes at 400F or for 60 minutes at 350F or 90 minutes at 325F in a regular oven. If you use convection ovens, you will have to bake the potatoes for 45 minutes at 375F or 60 minutes at 325F or 90 minutes at 300F. Convection ovens cook faster than regular ovens so the rule of thumb is to set the temperature in convection ovens at least 25F lower than you would set in a regular oven. The higher the baking temperature, the lesser the time required for baking. Baking time also depends on the size of the potatoes.",
            "Be sure the foil is well-sealed. Place on a baking sheet and put them into the oven to roast. 4. Check for doneness: Depending on the size of your potatoes, it may take between 30 minutes to 1 hour for them to be done. Check at 30 minutes by squeezing one of the potatoes in a oven mitt protected hand and inserting a sharp knife or fork into the center. They should feel quite soft and the knife should easily glide all the way through. If not return to the oven and check again in 10 minutes. 5."

            "Non-Silicate Minerals. Minerals can be classified as either silicate - that is, containing silicon and oxygen - or non-silicate - that is, lacking silicon. While most of the earth's crust is composed of silicate minerals, several non-silicate minerals are of great importance.",
            "Silicates constitute the majority of Earth's crust, as well as the other terrestrial planets, rocky moons, and asteroids. Sand, Portland cement, and thousands of minerals are examples of silicates. Silicate compounds, including the minerals, consist of silicate anions whose charge is balanced by various cations.",
            "For anion, see Orthosilicate (ion). Silicate minerals are rock-forming minerals made up of silicate groups. They are the largest and most important class of rock-forming minerals and make up approximately 90 percent of the Earth's crust. They are classified based on the structure of their silicate groups, which contain different ratios of silicon and oxygen.",
            "A silicate is a compound containing an anionic silicon compound. The great majority of the silicates are oxides, but hexafluorosilicate ([SiF6]2\u2212) and other anions are also included. Orthosilicate is the anion SiO4\u2212.",
            "While most minerals are silicates, many non-silicate minerals are found in the earth's crust and are important as well. This lesson will use examples and describe the three major groups of non-silicate minerals, including carbonates, halides and sulfates.",
            "The main minerals found in many rocks. Silicates are composed of atoms of silicon, oxygen, and elements such as potassium, sodium, or calcium, under great heat and pressure. Silicates make up about one-quarter of the crust of the Earth.",
            "Any of a large class of chemical compounds composed of silicon, oxygen, and at least one metal. Most rocks and minerals are silicates. Silicates are also one of the main components of bricks. 2. Any mineral containing the group SiO4 in its crystal lattice. Micas and feldspars are silicate minerals.",
            "The Silicates. Building Blocks of The Earth\u2019s Crust. Silicates are the most widespread of the minerals. They are made up of oxygen and silicon the number one and number two most abundant elements in the earth's crust. By themselves they make up over 90% of the weight of the earth\u2019s crust. Most rocks are composed mainly of this class of minerals.",
            "silicates in Science. Any of a large class of chemical compounds composed of silicon, oxygen, and at least one metal. Most rocks and minerals are silicates. Any mineral containing the group SiO4, either isolated, or joined to other groups in chains, sheets, or three-dimensional groups with metal elements.",
            "The most abundant elements in the Earth's crust are oxygen (46.6%) and silicon (27.7%). Minerals which combine these two elements are called silicates, and combined they are the most abundant minerals on the Earth. The silicates can be organized in terms of their chemical compositions and their crystal structures (indicated by the existence of cleavage planes). They most often contain members of the Big 8 elements."

            "Welcome to Johnny's Shotgun Chokes and Forcing Cones... Twenty five years ago, the most requested alteration to a shotgun barrel was screw-in choke tube installation. Twenty five years ago, the least (almost never) requested alteration to the shotgun barrel was lengthening of the forcing cone. This has all changed.",
            "Below I will explain the forcing cone, what it does and how it can be modified to improve the performance of a shotgun. The Mysterious Forcing Cone. The forcing cone is the constriction at the end of the chamber that forces the load down from chamber size to the size of your shotgun bore.",
            "Forcing cones. The area just forward of your shotgun\u2019s chamber is the forcing cone; a funnel reducing the diameter of the chamber - down to bore size. An excited shooter was worried that the forcing cone area might be damaged by tough wads. Blaming plastic wads for impact is like blaming football shoulder pads for hard impacts.",
            "Backboring is a term that is mostly misunderstood as being the forcing cone due to the fact that when working on the forcing cone area you are working on the back end of the barrel then afterwards the barrel is supposedly ''backbored'' but in reality it is the actual bore of the gun from just ahead of the forcing cone all the way through the barrel ...",
            "Lengthen Forcing Cones To Improve Patterns, Reduce Recoil. Double-duty reamers lengthen short chambers to modern standard or magnum lengths and cut the new long forcing cone at the same time - OR - will cut a long forcing cone without lengthening the chamber for the gunsmith seeking improved shooting performance for his customer.",
            "The 1\u00bd long (approximately) forcing cone created is performance proven to give optimum results in any length chamber. Reamers are ground exclusively for us from special, select tool steel by one of the oldest and most respected manufacturers of reamers in the United States. Quality and performance is 100% guaranteed.",
            "Forcing Cone Pictures? This is a discussion on Forcing Cone Pictures? within the Ruger Single Action forums, part of the Pistol & Revolver Forum category; Does anyone have a picture of before/after of refacing their forcing cone? Looking at the entrance to the barrell on my 45Colt, it looks relatively ...",
            "Nice video, but he forgot the most critical part. The forcing cone is a very misunderstood part of the revolver barrel and even many professional gunsmiths don't really understand them. THE critical dimension of a forcing cone is not the depth or angle of the cone, it's the diameter of the MOUTH of the forcing cone. That outer mouth dimension is critical."
