            "In a 2008 study, men who ate 7 or more eggs per week versus less than one had a twofold greater risk for all cause mortality, presumably from heart disease.",
            "The concern with eggs has to do with their high cholesterol content - 190 milligrams per one egg. Nutrition guidelines to keep LDL (bad) blood cholesterol in the desirable range have emphasized limiting dietary cholesterol-abundant in egg yolks, shrimp, liver and duck-to less than 300 milligrams per day.",
            "In the Department of Health analysis it was found that eggs contain around 20 per cent less fat, 13 per cent fewer calories and 10 per cent less cholesterol than 30 years ago. In one study, overweight women had eggs or a bagel for breakfast.",
            "And if you are also eating a diet high in saturated fat, the cholesterol in eggs can have a more profound effect on your bad \u201cLDL\u201d cholesterol levels. Eating the same foods day after day may help you maintain your weight. \u201cIt\u2019s about limiting choices,\u201d explains Smith.",
            "Eggs are well known for their protein but they also contain vitamins B-12 and A. One large egg has 78 calories and 6.3 grams of quality protein. This means that women get 14 percent and men gain 11 percent of their recommended daily allowance of protein.",
            "I know they contain cholesterol, but I\u2019m currently eating six a day while cutting.\u201d. A: Whoa, there! Six eggs a day is far too many, no matter how you cut it. An egg has 187 mg of cholesterol, and the recommended limit is 300 mg per day\u2014or only 200 mg if you have diabetes or risk factors for heart disease.",
            "The Department of Health now says we can eat as many eggs as we like, as long as they form part of a healthy, balanced diet. There is no upper limit, says Bond, unless you have inherited high cholesterol. Of the Canadian study, she says that carotid plaque rises anyway with age after 40.",
            "If you're healthy, one whole egg a day seems perfectly safe. If you're a male with diabetes, it's prudent to limit egg yolks to four per week.

As one degree is 1\u2044360 of a circle, one minute of arc is 1\u204421600 of a circle (or, in radians, \u03c0\u204410800). It is used in fields that involve very small angles, such as astronomy, optometry, ophthalmology, optics, navigation, land surveying and marksmanship.",

Dividing both sides of the equation by 57.29578 we get about 0.01745329 radians = 1 degrees. So, the conversion factor to multiply by to convert from degrees to radians is about 0.01745329.",

            "Say you want to convert from radians to degrees. Since you can multiply anything by 1 and still retain the original value, but in different units, set it up so that radian will cancel out leaving you with degree. Since: 1 degree = 0.01745329 radians, 1 degree / 0.01745329 radians = 1. We can write the conversion as: 1 radian = 1 radian * (1 degree / 0.01745329 radians) = 57.29578 degrees.

            "The argument is nothing new. The LPN is quick to tell you she does so much more than make beds, give back rubs, and take vital signs. And the RN counters that she has more education and medical training and is called upon for more advanced procedures.",
            "As someone with RN training and no LPN experience, I'm still honestly confused by these two different nurse licenses.... so here goes... Many say a nurse is a nurse but that's not always the case. There is different designation and licensing for RNs and LPNs.",
            "However, under licensure, the LPN cannot interpret data, or make decisions for the patient. She has to report these findings to the RN or MD and they will make the decisions and delegate care. Because of the scope of their practice is limited by their license, it may seem like LPNs do less than RNs. The fact is, the LPN may only perform her job as far as she is legally allowed to.",
            "LPN vs. RN: What's the Difference? The decision to apply to nursing school is perhaps the most important career decision nurses make, but it is only the first. The second? Deciding whether to become a licensed practical nurse (LPN) or a registered nurse (RN).",
            "RN training requirements. The BLS notes that RNs can typically choose one of three education paths, namely: a diploma from an accredited nursing program, an associate degree in nursing (AND) or a bachelor's of science degree in nursing (BSN).",
            "They both work under RNs and doctors. LPN and LVN programs prepare you to take the NCLEX-PN. Passing the NCLEX-PN is required for licensure of both LPNs and LVNs. The biggest difference between a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) and a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) is actually the name.",
            "Among them: 1  RNs tend to have more responsibilities and independence in the workplace than LPNs. 2  RNs must usually complete more training than LPNs. 3  LPNs are in higher demand than RNs, nationally speaking.  RNs tend to earn more than LPNs.",
            "Within the nursing field are a number of titles, including Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) and Registered Nurse (RN). This post will help clarify some of the differences, qualifications and responsibilities of LPNs and LVNs. Licensed Vocational Nurses vs. Licensed Practical Nurses.",
            "LPNs vs. RNs. Licensed practical or vocational nurses represent the entry level of the profession. Their duties are confined to the basics of patient care, such as monitoring vital signs; helping patients bathe and addressing personal hygiene; assisting as needed at mealtime; and updating charts.",
            "The nursing profession is one of the most diverse in the health-care industry. Direct patient care is the nurse's primary responsibility, but this care takes many forms. At the entry level, licensed practical nurses and inexperienced registered nurses spend much of their time performing basic care of the bedpans and bathing variety."

Farmed salmon are raised and killed long before they amass a worrisome amount of mercury. Also, it depends on your gender.",

MayoClinic.com recommends eating salmon or other omega-rich fish twice weekly. Although seafood is often contaminated, salmon is a low-mercury choice. Therefore, Consumer Reports deems it safe to eat salmon every day -- unlike swordfish and fresh tuna, which have dangerous mercury levels.",

The American Heart Association recommends eating omega-3-rich fish, such as tuna, twice a week for good health. It's wise, however, to vary what you choose. Because tuna is a source of mercury, you should avoid eating it daily, especially higher-mercury varieties like albacore tuna.",

However, salmon is a lean protein that fits nicely into a healthy diet plan. Replacing fatty red meats and junk food in your diet with salmon may reduce overall calorie intake, eventually helping you lose body fat.",

As with the other distinctive features of mammals, the neocortex probably evolved as a part of a set of adaptations related to temperature homeostasis."

            "Diet for Diverticulitis. Gradually you can ease back into a regular diet. Your doctor may advise you to start with low-fiber foods (white bread, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products) before introducing high-fiber foods.",
            "The Diverticulitis Diet. It should be noted that there have also been studies that suggest eating too much fiber may lead to diverticular disease by causing more frequent bowel movements. The recommended amount of dietary fiber is 20 to 35 grams per day.",
            "Read the Travelers' Diarrhea: What You Need to Know article > >. Many experts believe that a low-fiber diet can lead to diverticulosis and diverticulitis. This may be why people in Asia and Africa, where the diet tends to be higher in fiber, have a very low incidence of the condition.",
            "However, on occasion, diverticula can become inflamed or infected, or they may tear. The inflammation can lead to a more chronic and serious condition known as diverticulitis. Once diverticulitis begins, it may cause serious health problems, including: nausea.",
            "The daily adequate intake amount for fiber has been calculated by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. Men ages 19 and older should strive for 38 grams a day and women ages 19 and older should aim for 25 grams a day. Fiber is in many foods, including beans, peas, other vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products. You can figure out how much fiber is in a food by looking at the nutrition facts label . If a food has fiber, it will be listed under the total carbohydrate on the label. The food label assumes the daily value (DV) of fiber is 25 grams a day (g/day) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Be sure to increase the amount of fiber in your diet slowly so that your stomach can adjust to the change. Adding too much fiber too quickly may cause stomach upset and gas. Some doctors recommend adding bran to your diet to help boost the fiber content. If you do this, start slowly with 1 teaspoon a day.",
            "Actually, no specific foods are known to trigger diverticulitis attacks. And no special diet has been proved to prevent attacks. In the past, people with small pouches in the lining of the colon (diverticula) were told to avoid nuts, seeds and popcorn. It was thought that these foods could lodge in diverticula and cause inflammation (diverticulitis). But there's no evidence that these foods cause diverticulitis. If you're trying to prevent diverticulitis attacks, focus on eating an overall healthy diet that's high in fiber. High-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, soften waste and help it pass more quickly through your colon.",
            "If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with diverticulitis, make sure to discuss your food needs and restrictions with your doctor. If you have not yet had that discussion, make a list of food-related questions before your next appointment.",
            "A high-fiber diet is one of the first things a doctor will recommend. That\u2019s because fiber, which is found naturally in healthier foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, can soften your body\u2019s waste material. Softer stool passes through your intestines and colon more quickly and easily.",
            "Sometimes, especially as they get older, people can develop little bulging pouches in the lining of the large intestine. These are called diverticula, and the condition is known as diverticulosis. When the pouches become inflamed or infected, it leads to a sometimes very painful condition called diverticulitis. In addition to having abdominal pain, people with diverticulitis may experience nausea, vomiting, bloating, fever, constipation, or diarrhea."

What causes trigeminal neuralgia? Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the nerve inside the skull that transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. The compression of the trigeminal nerve is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. In rare cases trigeminal neuralgia can be caused by damage to the trigeminal nerve as a result of an underlying condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.",
            "Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia. The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes. Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours. The atypical form results in a constant burning pain that is less severe. Episodes may be triggered by any touch to the face. Both forms may occur in the same",

Cultural geography is the branch of geography dealing with human culture and its impact on the Earth.f course, geography today means much more than writing about the Earth but it's a difficult discipline to define. Many geographers have done their best to define geography but a typical dictionary definition today reads, The science of the Earth's physical features, resources, climate, population, etc..",

However, it can also come and go throughout the day, depending on the severity of angina.",
