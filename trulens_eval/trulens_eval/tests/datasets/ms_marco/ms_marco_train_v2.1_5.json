However, salmon is a lean protein that fits nicely into a healthy diet plan. Replacing fatty red meats and junk food in your diet with salmon may reduce overall calorie intake, eventually helping you lose body fat.",

Include different types of fish in your diet that have less mercury but are good sources of omega-3s, such as salmon, anchovies and sardines. Also include other types of seafood or fish, such as shrimp, scallops, tilapia and haddock.",

Men ages 19 and older should strive for 38 grams a day and women ages 19 and older should aim for 25 grams a day. Fiber is in many foods, including beans, peas, other vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products. You can figure out how much fiber is in a food by looking at the nutrition facts label . If a food has fiber, it will be listed under the total carbohydrate on the label. The food label assumes the daily value (DV) of fiber is 25 grams a day (g/day) for a 2,000 calorie diet. Be sure to increase the amount of fiber in your diet slowly so that your stomach can adjust to the change. Adding too much fiber too quickly may cause stomach upset and gas. Some doctors recommend adding bran to your diet to help boost the fiber content. If you do this, start slowly with 1 teaspoon a day.",

It was thought that these foods could lodge in diverticula and cause inflammation (diverticulitis). But there's no evidence that these foods cause diverticulitis. If you're trying to prevent diverticulitis attacks, focus on eating an overall healthy diet that's high in fiber. High-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, soften waste and help it pass more quickly through your colon.",

In babies born with tricuspid atresia, the tricuspid valve is absent (1) and the right ventricle is small (2). In about 25% of babies, the position of the great arteries is also reversed. In some babies, there is also a severe narrowing at the pulmonary valve (3), or there can be complete absence of the pulmonary valve.

What causes trigeminal neuralgia? Trigeminal neuralgia is usually caused by compression of the trigeminal nerve. This is the nerve inside the skull that transmits sensations of pain and touch from your face, teeth and mouth to your brain. The compression of the trigeminal nerve is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. In rare cases trigeminal neuralgia can be caused by damage to the trigeminal nerve as a result of an underlying condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour.",
                        "Trigeminal neuralgia is a chronic pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia. The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes. Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours. The atypical form results in a constant burning pain that is less severe. Episodes may be triggered by any touch to the face. Both forms may occur in the same",

The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes.",
                        "Trigeminal neuralgia is sudden, severe facial pain. It's often described as a sharp shooting pain or like having an electric shock in the jaw, teeth or gums. It usually occurs in short, unpredictable attacks that can last from a few seconds to about two minutes. The attacks stop as suddenly as they start.",

How to fix it: In an electric-fencing system, Derynck reccomends fence post spacing 80-100 feet apart, or about 50 posts per mile. He suggests using a “stay” – a shorter post that sits on top of the ground and holds wires up – if posts are spaced 100 ft. apart.",

Posts may be driven or set with either power or hand tools. If you have more than a few hundred feet of fence to build, use a power driver or auger. Line posts should be set or driven to a minimum depth of 2-1/2 feet. Steel line posts must be oriented for proper wire placement when installed.",
