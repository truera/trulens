The goal of summative assessments is to make a judgment of student competency after an instructional phase is complete. For example, in Florida, the FCAT is administered once a year -- it is a summative assessment to determine each student's ability at pre-determined points in time.",

            "The lacrimal apparatus consists of the lacrimal glands, which secrete the tears, and the lacrimal sac and ducts, which convey the tears into the nasal cavity. Secretory function of the lacrimal glands declines with age, and many elderly individuals develop \u201cdry eye\u201d syndrome.",
            "The nasolacrimal duct (sometimes called the tear duct) carries tears from the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity. The opening of the nasolacrimal duct into the inferior nasal meatus is partially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner or plica lacrimalis). Excess tears flow through nasolacrimal duct which drains into the inferior nasal meatus.",
            "Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is the most common abnormality of the entire lacrimal system in children. It presents with recurrent tearing and eye discharge in the early newborn period without conjunctival injection or photophobia.",
            "The lacrimal sac or lachrymal sac[1] is the upper dilated end of the nasolacrimal duct, and is lodged in a deep groove formed by the lacrimal bone and frontal process of the maxilla. It connects the lacrimal canaliculi, which drain tears from the eye's surface, and the nasolacrimal duct, which conveys this fluid into the nasal cavity.",
            "The lacrimal gland, which secretes tears, lies over the upper, outer corner of the eye; its excretory ducts branch downward toward the eyeball. A constant stream of tears washes down over the front of the eye and is drained off through two small openings located in the inner corner of the eye. Through these openings the tears pass into the lacrimal canaliculus, then through the lacrimal sac into the nasolacrimal duct and finally into the nasal cavity.",
            "Excess tears are drained from the medial aspect of the conjunctival sac via the canaliculi into the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct, to empty into the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity (Fig. 1-63).",
            "a group of organs concerned with the production and drainage of tears; it is a nutritive and protective device that helps keep the eye moist and free of dust and other irritating particles. Includes lacrimal gland, accessory lacrimal glands, third eyelid glands and the nasolacrimal duct.",
            "Inflammation of the lacrimal-glands is called dacryoadenitis. The lacrimal-gland produces tears which then flow into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac. From that sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose. The lacrimal bone is the smallest and most fragile bone of the face; roughly the size of the little fingernail. It is situated at the front part of the medial wall of the orbit.",
            "The histologic features of nasolabial cysts show striking similarity to the physiologically encountered epithelia in the lacrimal drainage system, specifically the lacrimal canaliculi and sac and the nasolacrimal duct that drain tear fluid from the eye to the inferior meatus of the nose (Figure 1).",
            "Uncomplicated mechanical stenosis may occasionally be relieved with simple probing, but severe cases (often following bacterial infection of the lacrimal sac) are treated surgically: a dacryocystorhinostomy is performed to anastomose the mucosa of the nasal cavity to the lacrimal sac through an osteotomy made in the lacrimal bone. 15"

            "Peridotite is the dominant rock of the Earth's mantle above a depth of about 400 km; below that depth, olivine is converted to the higher-pressure mineral wadsleyite. Oceanic plates consist of up to about 100 km of peridotite covered by a thin crust; the crust, commonly about 6 km thick, consists of basalt, gabbro, and minor sediments. The peridotite below the ocean crust, abyssal peridotite, is found on the walls of rifts in the deep sea floor.",

Minerals are made up of crystalised molecules that have become cemented together - look closely at a chunk of granite for example, and you can see the individual crystals bound together. The difference is pressure, and temperature. Contrary to what many people believe, the mantle is not liquid magma.",

            "Feldspars are very common minerals in the crust, more than half (51%) of the crust is made up of this mineral group. Mica and clay minerals are also common, both comprise about 5% of the crust. Hence, aluminum is extremely widespread as well. It is usually not very concentrated in silicate minerals, though.",
            "Peridotite is the dominant rock of the upper part of the Earth's mantle. The compositions of peridotite nodules found in certain basalts and diamond pipes (kimberlites) are of special interest, because they provide samples of the Earth's mantle brought up from depths ranging from about 30 km to 200 km or more.",
            "Peridotite is a dense, coarse-grained igneous rock consisting mostly of the minerals olivine and pyroxene. Peridotite is ultramafic, as the rock contains less than 45% silica. It is high in magnesium, reflecting the high proportions of magnesium-rich olivine, with appreciable iron. Peridotite is derived from the Earth's mantle, either as solid blocks and fragments, or as crystals accumulated from magmas that formed in the mantle. The compositions of peridotites from these layered igneous complex",
            "The crust is compositionally distinct outermost rocky layer of the Earth. What is the crust made of? The answer to this question depends on whether we want to know which chemical elements, minerals or rock types it is made of. It may be surprising... This page may be out of date.",
            "The earth's crust is made up of rock that consists of primarily silicate minerals. Those are minerals like quartz, feldspar, pyroxene, amphibole, and mica. In addition to these major components, there are many lesser minerals, compounds, and elements... carbonates, oxides, sulfides, native metals, etc.",
            "Gabbro is a mafic intrusive rock. The sample from Cyprus (from the Troodos ophiolite which represents former oceanic crust) is 7 cm in width. Basalt is a volcanic equivalent of gabbro. The sample from Northern Ireland is 8 cm in width. Andesite is a common volcanic rock which is intermediate in composition between mafic and felsic rocks.",

            "Why Lifting Heavy is the Key to Weight Loss. You know that losing fat involves increasing your metabolism. What you may not know is that muscle plays a huge role in raising metabolism. A pound of muscle burns about 10-20 calories a day while a pound of fat burns 5 calories. That means any growth in your muscle tissue is going to help you burn more calories all day long. Increases resting metabolic rate so you burn more calories, even while at rest.",
            "When losing weight, you will lose some muscle mass along with body fat. If you don't perform resistance training regularly, up to 30% of the weight you lose can come from muscle tissue, which doesn't do your health, fitness or metabolism any favors in the long run.",
            "3/13/2014 5:00 AM3/13/2014 5:00 AM : 16 comments : 760,754 Views. If you are concerned about how many calories you burn during strength training, chances are that you are actively trying to lose weight (or might want to ensure you are eating enough to support strength training without losing additional weight).",
            "Typically, if you lift 60%-80% of max, you could do anywhere from 10-20 reps. Lifting at 80% and above takes you down to the lower rep range, which is where you'll be if you're trying to gain size. That means keeping your reps somewhere between 8-16, if you're lifting for weight loss and fitness. Your weights are determined by the number of reps you're doing. Choose a weight you can only lift 16 times. This is hit or miss, so you're experimenting.",
            "The calories burned while weight lifting will depend on your gender, weight, height, age, and the intensity of weight lifting. For example, if you are female, weigh 150 pounds (68kg), are 5 feet 4 inches tall, and are age 45, you will burn about 3 calories per minute, or 174 calories per hour during light weight lifting. There are a few formulas you can use to calculate how many calories you would burn during any physical activity. One of the formulas is: Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) x Metabolic equivalent of task (MET) Basal Metabolic Rate or BMR is the amount of calories you burn while resting, every 24 hours.",
            "Although strength training is challenging and requires a lot of hard work (especially when lifting heavy weights), it doesn't typically burn as many calories as cardiovascular (aerobic) exercises like running or cycling.",
            "The problem is that most of us don't think much about how much weight we need, much less going through the process of figuring out 1 rep max for every exercise we're doing. In fact, I see many gym-goers lifting the same weights week after week, which is just one way to keep your body from changing.",
            "MET for weight lifting is about 3 for light weight lifting, and about 6 for heavy weight lifting. So, the above example given will look like this: BMR: 655 + (4.35 x 150) + (4.7 x 64) \u2013 (4.7 x 45) = 1397 calories per 24 hours, 58 calories per hour. MET: 3.0.",
            "You burn calories while doing work. Lifting weights is work. The longer you lift and to some extent, the more you lift, the more calories you will burn. You can see from this chart, that for most men, weight training will consume 300 - 500 Kcal/hour while running will consume 500 - 1300 Kcal/hr.",
            "Gaining 30 pounds of muscle increases your RMR by 180 calories (average 6 calories per pound per day). While this might not seem large, at the end of the week that's 1260 calories which is the equivalent of two *hard* one hour workouts or a 1/3 pound of fat."

Surgery may be considered if you have severe pain and loss of shoulder function that has not responded to appropriate nonsurgical treatment.",

They found that when 10 kg of fat were oxidized, 8.4 kg were converted and excreted as carbon dioxide (CO2) via the lungs, and 1.6 kg became water (H20). In order for 10 kg of human fat to be oxidized, the researchers calculated that 29 kg of oxygen must be inhaled.",

Balancing the calories you eat with the calories you expend is a sound strategy. In fact, it\u2019s what Meerman did when he trimmed down last year. \u201cI was drinking three cappuccinos made with full cream milk each day, and I\u2019d hit 40 years of age,\u201d he says. \u201cYour metabolism slows a bit as you get older so you can\u2019t consume as many calories and expect to stay slim.",

The ABO blood group system is the best known surface antigen system, expressed on a wide variety of human cells.For Caucasian populations about one fifth of all pregnancies have ABO incompatibility between the fetus and the mother, but only a very small minority develop symptomatic ABO HDN.The latter typically only occurs in mothers of blood group O, because they can produce enough IgG antibodies to cause hemolysis.f IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN.

            "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn (also known as ABO HDN) maternal IgG antibodies with specificity for the ABO blood group system pass through the placenta to the fetal circulation where they can cause hemolysis of fetal red blood cells which can lead to fetal anemia and HDN.f IgG anti-A or IgG anti-B antibodies are found in the pregnant woman's blood, they are not reported with the test results, because they do not correlate well with ABO HDN. Diagnosis is usually made by investigation of a newborn baby who has developed jaundice during the first day of life.",
            "If a baby is an O blood group-it will not be effected. If the baby is an A blood group-the baby may or may not be effected.

Since the edges of both can't be in the same place, one plate will be forced under another plate (and the other above). The plate going 'down' will thus go deeper into the earth - allowing deeper earthquakes to occur.",

            "What are Outriggers Used For? Mainly used in deep sea trolling, outriggers are a pair of long poles fitted on both sides of a boat that holds fishing lines away from the boat.It is usually made of fiberglass and aluminum, and is tilted at an angle between 70 to 80 degrees.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.",
            "When being used, outriggers are lowered to an angle nearly the same level as the water\u2019s surface. At the edge of each outrigger is a pulley with a cord, attached to which is a quick release clip that holds the fishing line.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.",
            "In an outrigger canoe and in sailboats such as the proa, an outrigger is a thin, long, solid, hull used to stabilise an inherently unstable main hull.The outrigger is positioned rigidly and parallel to the main hull so that the main hull is less likely to capsize.If only one outrigger is used on a vessel, its weight reduces the tendency to capsize in one direction and its buoyancy reduces the tendency in the other direction.ooden outriggers appear on the new Trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300 while Harry Clasper (1812\u20131870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern metal version.",

            "Outriggers also hold the fishing lines at a distance from both sides of the boat, spreading the lines far enough to prevent the risk of tangling. With more lines in the water, the angler can set them at different distances and depths that can create a variety of natural patterns to increase the chances of a strike.enerally, outriggers improve the chances of a fish striking because not only does it allow the angler to cover more ocean space, it also permits the use of multiple lines.",
            "The outrigger float is called the ama in many Polynesian and Micronesian languages. The spars connecting the ama to the main hull (or the two hulls in a double-hull canoe) are called \u02bbiako in Hawaiian and kiato in M\u0101ori (with similar words in other Polynesian languages); in Micronesian languages, the term aka is used.n an outrigger canoe the paddlers sit in line, facing toward the bow of the canoe (i.e. forward, in the direction of travel, unlike rowing). The seats are numbered from 1 (closest to the bow) to the number of seats in the canoe, usually 6.",
            "Outriggers telescope out away from a fishing boat to be able to drop fishing bait lines up to several feet away from the boat into the water. When a fish bites on the bait, the line rigged into the outrigger automatically transfers to a fishing pole that is properly secured into a gunnel on the boat.ooden outriggers appear on the new Trireme around the 7th or 6th centuries BC and later on Italian galleys around AD 1300 while Harry Clasper (1812\u20131870), a British professional rower, popularised the use of the modern metal version.",
