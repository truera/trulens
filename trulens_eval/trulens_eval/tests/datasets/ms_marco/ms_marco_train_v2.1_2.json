                        "This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.",

When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.",
                        "American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there.",
                        "The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.",
                        "The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.",

In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).

As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nation’s largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.",
                        "This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China."

                        "The Benefits of a Weak Dollar Despite expressions to the contrary by politicos and economists, the nature of a weak dollar can actually benefit stagnated portions of our economy. For example, a weak U.S. dollar will actually help boost the manufacturing sector. A weak dollar can also help sell U.S. made goods in overseas markets at lower prices. A weak dollar will benefit a few European retailers who import Asian products bought for dollars and sell them in European markets for stronger euro payments.",
                        "Or still too weak to give up the aggregate demand benefits of a weak dollar? It’s obviously stronger than it has been, but it still isn’t strong. Normally, the answer to the above question is easy if the dollar rises because of greater competitiveness and an improving international trade balance.",
                        "The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben S. Bernanke has embraced a weak dollar policy. And he is not alone. The weak dollar mantra is very much in evidence on most of the boulevards and in the back alleys of Washington, D.C. The idea even has a certain appeal to the common man on the street. After all, a cheap dollar is advertised as an export stimulant and the fuel for an economic boom.",
                        "The weak dollar is good for manufacturers in the U.S., whether they're the Big Three or German or whatever, because they can export at an advantage, says Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Edmunds.com. That advantage makes the U.S. a good place to manufacture goods, and that's after decades of manufacturing fleeing abroad.",
                        "From the broad macro perspective, a stronger dollar benefits the domestic population by improving their terms of trade with the outside world. By that, economists mean we get more imports (the benefits of trade) per dollar of exports (the cost of trade). Much bad trade policy is based on the confusion over which is the cost of trade and which is the benefit.",
                        "But a major reason for the strong dollar recently is the falling Euro, Japanese yen, Australian and Canadian dollars, etc. Weaker foreign currencies are the mirror image of a stronger dollar and shouldn’t pose a problem.",
                        "Net, net, a stronger dollar is likely a headwind in a weak economy. In a stronger, fully-employed economy, a rising dollar will still act as a headwind in that it reduces total effective demand, but the benefits to consumers in particular and the population generally will likely more than offset that negative.",
                        "Weak Dollar? That's Good For U.S. Exports The dollar has been falling relative to other currencies, making buying imports more expensive in the U.S. On the other hand, it also means U.S. exports are more competitive around the world. That shift could be good news for U.S. manufacturers, especially the auto industry.",
                        "Thanks to the Fed’s weak dollar policy, the U.S. faces an inflation problem and so does the rest of the world. The weak dollar and the lack of “flexibility” — properly understood — also threaten the free flow of capital and the stability of the international monetary system.",
                        "As with most things, a balance between a strong dollar and a weak dollar is the best for our economy and stock investors. Consumers pay reasonable prices for imported goods and our manufacturers can compete in the global marketplace."

The bulk of the Grevy's zebra diet consists of these fibrous, tougher-textured grasses, along with forbs.",

                        "Other Forms of Sustenance. Although grass certainly makes up the bulk of a zebra's menu, they do occasionally eat other things. Other types of zebra foods include fruit, buds, roots, herbs, shoots and shrubs.",
                        "The zebra’s main predator or natural enemy is the lion. But other creatures attack, kill and eat zebras as well. Huge crocodiles often catch zebras when they are swimming across African rivers. Other four-legged natural enemies of the zebra, the wildebeest, and other African herbivores include leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. As for what a zebra eats, zebras are grazers.

Zebras in zoos eat pallets specially made for herbivores, which supply them with more nutrients than hay.",
                        "Grass is the basic diet of mountain and plain zebras. It forms about 92% of their overall diets. They eat red grass, Bermuda grass that they find along the riverbeds and short grasses like common finger. Zebras also eat herbs and shrubs which constitute about 5% and 2% of their diet plan respectively.",

The three-model lineup inspired the three shields in the new design. Each carried over the stag head and gold cross cues from the previous single-shield design. As with the original shield design, the tri-shield design evolved. By the early 1970s, a ring motif surrounded the shields and the white color of one of the shields changed to silver. By the late 1970s, the tri-shield was used primarily on hood ornaments on some models, while the symbol of a hawk on the Buick name was used as the official logo, particularly in print and television advertising."

After you have completed a series of Fraxel treatments it is always recommended to do a follow up every 4-6 months to maintain your results.",
                        "February 10, 2008. I hear about bad swelling & pain stories following Fraxel treatments - how do I prevent my face from swelling? I don't drink alcohol or smoke & I walk 4 miles every day & eat lots of fruits & vegetables.... Please advice me, I am beginning to be afraid. Thank you.",
                        "Fraxel is nothing like the laser treatment that tore up my arms, nor even like the laser facial-resurfacing treatments of yesteryear, which required three to four weeks of downtime hiding from your friends. Fraxel works by causing controlled micro-injury to the skin, and the magic happens during the repair process.",
                        "Step 1. Avoid using skin products such as Retin-A, Avage and retinols for at least a week before Fraxel treatment, according to the University of Missouri. You should also avoid chemical skin peels. This will ensure your skin is in the optimum state to make a speedy recovery after a Fraxel treatment.",
                        "Apply ice packs to the reddened area immediately after a Fraxel session to reduce swelling and redness. Fraxel practitioners recommend applying an ice pack for five to 10 minutes every two to three hours until the swelling subsides. Apply sunscreen twice a day after your Fraxel treatment.",
                        "Dr. Lupo has answered your question beautifully, I agree with her 100%. Smoking, drinking alcohol, and sun exposure all contribute to lessen the results of Fraxel re:pair laser treatments. I have seen both immediate as well as continued later improvement in acne scar patients following Fraxel repair. Everyone's skin and healing capability are different.",
                        "Since I recovered so quickly with relatively few issues, Dr. Weiser decided to “up the power” and also increase me to the full eight passes. For treatment two, she used the Fraxel Dual, rather than the Re:store, which can target pigmentation a bit better. For the third treatment, she went back to the Re:store. With the increased power, I had to stop her more times than during my first treatment because it hurt so much my eyes were tearing.",
                        "Dry Skin. Another one of the fraxel laser side effects is dry skin, so it is very important that you ask for product as an after-care treatment. Sometimes your dermatologist will offer products designed specifically to speed the recovery of laser treatment. There are also various moisturizers you can use as well.",
                        "If you smoke, drink alcohol, and do not use sun protection, the results will diminish quicker. It is very important that you continue to use a good sunscreen, as well as a Vitamin C serum, we like SkinCeutical's C&E Ferulic. We do recommend a touch up treatment every six months.",
                        "The nice thing about Thermage and Fraxel treatments is that they can be repeated when it becomes necessary again. I always tell my patients that if they are not going to take care of their skin why invest in cosmetic procedures. 7 years ago by LazaDerm Skincare Centre - Sioux Falls (View Profile)"

                        "Most cases of bacterial conjunctivitis improve quickly after starting antibiotics for pink eye treatment. Within 24 to 48 hours, redness, irritation, and eye discharge should begin to improve. Even as symptoms improve, you should continue to take your antibiotics for the full course. Allergic Pink Eye.",
                        "Many people are aware that pink eye is a highly infectious condition, but how long is pink eye contagious? People with this condition are contagious for up to 14 days, in the case of viral conjunctivitis, and up to 24 hours after an antibiotic is started with bacterial conjunctivitis. You should limit contact during this period (typically until there is no more eye discharge).",
                        "If your pink eye is caused by a common viral infection and no other complications occur, then your eyes should clear up within a few days to two weeks. Pink eye also can be caused by bacterial conjunctivitis, which — even with treatment such as prescription antibiotic eye drops — can last up to a month or longer. However, with this type of pink eye, people should no longer be contagious 24 hours after antibiotic treatment begins. Recommended For You.",
                        "Again, please discuss this with your child's pediatrician. As long as your child's doctor initially examined him, it should be known how long he should stay away from other kids. As a general rule, 24 hours after the symptoms are completely gone he probably isn't contagious anymore, but that rule is not 100%.",
                        "The conjunctiva is the clear outer lining of the eye. When it gets inflamed, the blood vessels fill with blood causing it to turn red or pink hence the name pink eye. There are many different types of conjunctivitis, but the 2 most common are allergic and viral."

                        "As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved.",
                        "Convergent boundary. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.",
                        "Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater (Iceland is an exception) and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.",
                        "There are basically three different types of plate boundaries (divergent, convergent, transform), and a fourth type (boundary zones) is sometimes designated when it is difficult to define a clear boundary: 1  Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other.",
                        "A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust.",
                        "Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Superheated molten lava, about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, is about to explode into the water at the West Mata volcano along the Pacific Ring of Fire.",
                        "Deep trenches are often formed where tectonic plates are being subducted and earthquakes are common. As the sinking plate moves deeper into the mantle, fluids are released from the rock causing the overlying mantle to partially melt.",
                        "Shane Shurock and Barret Dolan Effects: The effects are deep earthquakes, an oceanic trench, a chain of volcanic islands, and the annihilation of oceanic lithosphere. The Pacific and Caroline plates form s volcanic islands and trenches.",
                        "The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary. These island arcs are always landward of the neighboring trenches. When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary.",
                        "1 Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. 2  Convergent boundaries -- where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. 3  Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other."

Plant cells have very large vacuoles which function in storing nutrients and water within the cell. They can also serve a structural function by helping the plant cell to retain its shape through turgidity. Vesicles typically function through transportation of compounds within and between cells. Often, the substances within a vesicle will be cellular products or byproducts of a cells functioning. Typically vesicles function in much the same way in all cells. Vacuoles serve a variety of functions depending on the cell in which they are found. In most animal cells where vacuoles occur, they function in the temporary storage of food substances.",

                        "The three main factors that play into this are temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. Another factor are the particles in the air that allow the vapor to condensate on them, e.g. dust. You can even see your breath condensate at room temperature if the conditions are met. All that is required is that the exhaled air has to be saturated with humidity to reach a point of about 5 percent above the relative humidity of the air in the room.",
                        "When you exhale when it's cold outside, the water vapor in your breath condenses into lots of tiny droplets of liquid water and ice (solid water) that you can see in the air as a cloud, similar to fog.",
                        "When exhaled, air mixes with cold air, the temperature of the exhaled air drops, but there is more water vapour. When the air becomes saturated, (relative humidity is 100%), the extra water vapour will condense, allowing you to see your breathe on cold days.",

                        "As a rule of thumb, the temperature must be below 50 degrees (F) to see one's breath. The phenomenon is dependent on a number of criteria, including pressure and humidity. It is possible to make one's breath visible at room temperatures by partially pressurizing your exhaled breath.",
                        "There's no exact temperature at which condensation will occur. Many environmental factors other than temperature can play a role in condensation, including relative humidity (the amount of moisture in the air). When it falls below 45° F (7.22° C), though, you can usually expect to be able to see your breath."

                        "Yield to maturity is a useful measure of the attractiveness of a seasoned bond that is held to maturity and redeemed at par value. For example, suppose you buy a $1000 par value ABC Company bond with a 5% coupon rate maturing in five years, and the market price for the bond is $900.",

If a bond with a par value of $1,000 is paying you $80 per year, then the coupon rate would be 8% (80 ÷ 1000 = .08, or 8%). Years to maturity: The number of years remaining before the bond reaches its maturity date. The maturity is the date the par or face value of the bond is returned to the bond holder.",
                        "This yield to maturity calculator assumes that the bond is not called prior to maturity. If the bond you're analyzing is callable, use our Yield to Call (YTC) calculator to determine the bond’s value. What it Means... If you buy this bond today, you will earn 10.63% per year. If the bond you’re analyzing is callable, you should use the Yield to Call (YTC) calculator.",

Mouse over the blue question marks for a further explanation of each entry field.",

On redemption of the bond after five years, you get the face value of $1000 for the matured bond and realize $100 in capital gain. Yield to maturity takes into account both interest and capital gain return on the bond and is calculated using the following steps. Ad.",
                        "The coupon rate is the annual interest rate the issuer will pay on the amount borrowed. For example, if a bond has a par value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 8%, then you will receive annual coupon (interest) payments of $80 (1000 X .08 = $80) until the bond's maturity date. Most bonds make coupon payments semi-annually, so you would likely receive a $40 coupon payment two times each year.",
