            "This was not true of the Industrial Workers of the World and as a result many of its members were first and second generation immigrants. Several immigrants such as Mary 'Mother' Jones, Hubert Harrison, Carlo Tresca, Arturo Giovannitti and Joe Haaglund Hill became leaders of the organization.",
            "Chinese Immigration and the Chinese Exclusion Acts. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.",
            "The Rise of Industrial America, 1877-1900. When in 1873 Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner entitled their co-authored novel The Gilded Age, they gave the late nineteenth century its popular name. The term reflected the combination of outward wealth and dazzle with inner corruption and poverty.",
            "American objections to Chinese immigration took many forms, and generally stemmed from economic and cultural tensions, as well as ethnic discrimination. Most Chinese laborers who came to the United States did so in order to send money back to China to support their families there.",
            "The rise of industrial America, the dominance of wage labor, and the growth of cities represented perhaps the greatest changes of the period. Few Americans at the end of the Civil War had anticipated the rapid rise of American industry.",
            "The resulting Angell Treaty permitted the United States to restrict, but not completely prohibit, Chinese immigration. In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.",
            "Industrial Workers of the World. In 1905 representatives of 43 groups who opposed the policies of American Federation of Labour, formed the radical labour organisation, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's goal was to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class.",
            "The railroads powered the industrial economy. They consumed the majority of iron and steel produced in the United States before 1890. As late as 1882, steel rails accounted for 90 percent of the steel production in the United States. They were the nation\u2019s largest consumer of lumber and a major consumer of coal.",
            "This finally resulted in legislation that aimed to limit future immigration of Chinese workers to the United States, and threatened to sour diplomatic relations between the United States and China."

            "However, there are safety concerns that come with nuclear power, including the possibility that a nuclear power plant could accidentally release radiation into the environment or be targeted for a terrorist attack. There is also the issue of what to do with radioactive waste.In this lesson, we will explore the risks associated with nuclear power and discuss how radioactive waste is handled. Most nuclear reactors are based on the concept of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission occurs when uranium nuclei are bombarded with neutrons.he isotope U-235 is important because it can be used in the nuclear fission chain reaction to create a lot of energy. Unlike the uranium used in a nuclear bomb, which is about 90% enriched with the isotope U-235, the uranium used in a nuclear reactor is only slightly enriched, to about four or five percent.",

            "The actual risk depends on several factors: 1  The specific radioactive materials, or isotopes, released, and the quantities released. 2  How a person comes into contact with the released radioactive materials (such as through contaminated food, water, air, or on the skin).n the most severe kinds of accidents, such as the Chernobyl accident in 1986, other dangerous radioactive isotopes, such as strontium-90 (Sr-90) and plutonium-239, may also be released. Human exposure to I-131 released from nuclear power plant accidents comes mainly from consuming contaminated water, milk, or foods."

For example, a weak U.S. dollar will actually help boost the manufacturing sector. A weak dollar can also help sell U.S. made goods in overseas markets at lower prices. A weak dollar will benefit a few European retailers who import Asian products bought for dollars and sell them in European markets for stronger euro payments.",

Normally, the answer to the above question is easy if the dollar rises because of greater competitiveness and an improving international trade balance.",

The weak dollar mantra is very much in evidence on most of the boulevards and in the back alleys of Washington, D.C. The idea even has a certain appeal to the common man on the street. After all, a cheap dollar is advertised as an export stimulant and the fuel for an economic boom.",
            "The weak dollar is good for manufacturers in the U.S., whether they're the Big Three or German or whatever, because they can export at an advantage, says Michelle Krebs, an analyst for Edmunds.com. That advantage makes the U.S. a good place to manufacture goods, and that's after decades of manufacturing fleeing abroad.",
            "From the broad macro perspective, a stronger dollar benefits the domestic population by improving their terms of trade with the outside world. By that, economists mean we get more imports (the benefits of trade) per dollar of exports (the cost of trade). Much bad trade policy is based on the confusion over which is the cost of trade and which is the benefit.",
            "But a major reason for the strong dollar recently is the falling Euro, Japanese yen, Australian and Canadian dollars, etc. Weaker foreign currencies are the mirror image of a stronger dollar and shouldn\u2019t pose a problem.",
            "Net, net, a stronger dollar is likely a headwind in a weak economy. In a stronger, fully-employed economy, a rising dollar will still act as a headwind in that it reduces total effective demand, but the benefits to consumers in particular and the population generally will likely more than offset that negative.",
            "Weak Dollar? That's Good For U.S. Exports The dollar has been falling relative to other currencies, making buying imports more expensive in the U.S. On the other hand, it also means U.S. exports are more competitive around the world. That shift could be good news for U.S. manufacturers, especially the auto industry.",
            "Thanks to the Fed\u2019s weak dollar policy, the U.S. faces an inflation problem and so does the rest of the world. The weak dollar and the lack of \u201cflexibility\u201d \u2014 properly understood \u2014 also threaten the free flow of capital and the stability of the international monetary system.",

The three-model lineup inspired the three shields in the new design. Each carried over the stag head and gold cross cues from the previous single-shield design. As with the original shield design, the tri-shield design evolved. By the early 1970s, a ring motif surrounded the shields and the white color of one of the shields changed to silver.

            "February 10, 2008. I hear about bad swelling & pain stories following Fraxel treatments - how do I prevent my face from swelling? I don't drink alcohol or smoke & I walk 4 miles every day & eat lots of fruits & vegetables.... Please advice me, I am beginning to be afraid. Thank you.",
            "Fraxel is nothing like the laser treatment that tore up my arms, nor even like the laser facial-resurfacing treatments of yesteryear, which required three to four weeks of downtime hiding from your friends. Fraxel works by causing controlled micro-injury to the skin, and the magic happens during the repair process.",
            "Step 1. Avoid using skin products such as Retin-A, Avage and retinols for at least a week before Fraxel treatment, according to the University of Missouri. You should also avoid chemical skin peels. This will ensure your skin is in the optimum state to make a speedy recovery after a Fraxel treatment.",
            "Apply ice packs to the reddened area immediately after a Fraxel session to reduce swelling and redness. Fraxel practitioners recommend applying an ice pack for five to 10 minutes every two to three hours until the swelling subsides. Apply sunscreen twice a day after your Fraxel treatment.",
            "Dr. Lupo has answered your question beautifully, I agree with her 100%. Smoking, drinking alcohol, and sun exposure all contribute to lessen the results of Fraxel re:pair laser treatments. I have seen both immediate as well as continued later improvement in acne scar patients following Fraxel repair. Everyone's skin and healing capability are different.",
            "Since I recovered so quickly with relatively few issues, Dr. Weiser decided to \u201cup the power\u201d and also increase me to the full eight passes. For treatment two, she used the Fraxel Dual, rather than the Re:store, which can target pigmentation a bit better. For the third treatment, she went back to the Re:store. With the increased power, I had to stop her more times than during my first treatment because it hurt so much my eyes were tearing.",
            "Dry Skin. Another one of the fraxel laser side effects is dry skin, so it is very important that you ask for product as an after-care treatment. Sometimes your dermatologist will offer products designed specifically to speed the recovery of laser treatment. There are also various moisturizers you can use as well.",
            "If you smoke, drink alcohol, and do not use sun protection, the results will diminish quicker. It is very important that you continue to use a good sunscreen, as well as a Vitamin C serum, we like SkinCeutical's C&E Ferulic. We do recommend a touch up treatment every six months.",
            "The nice thing about Thermage and Fraxel treatments is that they can be repeated when it becomes necessary again. I always tell my patients that if they are not going to take care of their skin why invest in cosmetic procedures. 7 years ago by LazaDerm Skincare Centre - Sioux Falls (View Profile)"

            "As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle, earthquakes and volcanoes are common near convergent boundaries. When two plates move towards one another, they form either a subduction zone or a continental collision. This depends on the nature of the plates involved.",
            "Convergent boundary. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. In plate tectonics, a convergent boundary, also known as a destructive plate boundary (because of subduction), is an actively deforming region where two (or more) tectonic plates or fragments of the lithosphere move toward one another and collide.",
            "Along these boundaries, magma rises from deep within the Earth and erupts to form new crust on the lithosphere. Most divergent plate boundaries are underwater (Iceland is an exception) and form submarine mountain ranges called oceanic spreading ridges.",
            "There are basically three different types of plate boundaries (divergent, convergent, transform), and a fourth type (boundary zones) is sometimes designated when it is difficult to define a clear boundary: 1  Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other.",
            "A subduction zone is formed at a convergent plate boundary when one or both of the tectonic plates is composed of oceanic crust. The denser plate, made of oceanic crust, is subducted underneath the less dense plate, which can be either continental or oceanic crust.",
            "Deep ocean trenches, volcanoes, island arcs, submarine mountain ranges, and fault lines are examples of features that can form along plate tectonic boundaries. Superheated molten lava, about 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, is about to explode into the water at the West Mata volcano along the Pacific Ring of Fire.",
            "Deep trenches are often formed where tectonic plates are being subducted and earthquakes are common. As the sinking plate moves deeper into the mantle, fluids are released from the rock causing the overlying mantle to partially melt.",
            "Shane Shurock and Barret Dolan Effects: The effects are deep earthquakes, an oceanic trench, a chain of volcanic islands, and the annihilation of oceanic lithosphere. The Pacific and Caroline plates form s volcanic islands and trenches.",
            "The new magma (molten rock) rises and may erupt violently to form volcanoes, often building arcs of islands along the convergent boundary. These island arcs are always landward of the neighboring trenches. When two plates are moving away from each other, we call this a divergent plate boundary.",
            "1 Divergent boundaries -- where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other. 2  Convergent boundaries -- where crust is destroyed as one plate dives under another. 3  Transform boundaries -- where crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other."

            "The femoral nerve is one of the largest nerves in your leg. It\u2019s located near the groin and controls the muscles that help straighten your leg and move your hips. It also provides feeling in the lower part of your leg and the front of your thigh.",
            "The largest nerve that emerges from the lumbar plexus is the femoral nerve, which descends beneath the inguinal ligament before dividing into a number of smaller branches innervating the anterior thigh musculature and skin . One pure sensory branch, the saphenous nerve, continues down the medial leg to the arch of the foot.",
            "Femoral nerve block with local anesthetic and steroid is occasionally used in the treatment of persistent lower extremity pain when the pain is thought to be secondary to inflammation or when entrapment of the femoral nerve as it passes under the inguinal ligament is suspected.",
            "The femoral artery is a very large artery that lies close to the femoral nerve. In trauma they are often injured together. Injury to or bleeding in the artery can cause compression on the nerve. Additionally, because the femoral nerve provides sensation to a major portion of the leg, injuries can occur due to this loss of sensation.",
            "In the thigh, the nerve lies in a groove between iliacus muscle and psoas major muscles, outside the femoral sheath, and lateral to the femoral artery. After a short course of about 4 cm in the thigh, the nerve is divided into anterior and posterior divisions, separated by lateral femoral circumflex artery.",
            "Mononeuritis multiplex is the femoral nerve dysfunction due to systemic disorder of femoral nerve. Entrapment of femoral nerve also damages myelin sheath or axons (nerve fibers). Due to this the impulses are not passed on properly via nerve. If pelvic bone is broken, femoral nerve can get damaged.",
            "The femoral nerve is present in leg and provides assistance in the leg straightening action. Sensation to the thigh front and lower leg is provided by femoral nerve. Pelvic fracture is the major problem associated with this nerve. In case the femoral nerve is damaged, it is indicated by weakness in leg or impaired movement or sensation of leg. Recovery is possible if the exact reason for femoral nerve dysfunction is diagnosed."

            "If the temperature of the air is equal to the dewpoint, it's foggy. So, sure, if the air temperature is less than the dewpoint of your breath, that's how you get foggy breath. But it has little to do with the dewpoint of the air around you.",
            "The three main factors that play into this are temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. Another factor are the particles in the air that allow the vapor to condensate on them, e.g. dust. You can even see your breath condensate at room temperature if the conditions are met. All that is required is that the exhaled air has to be saturated with humidity to reach a point of about 5 percent above the relative humidity of the air in the room.",

            "As a rule of thumb, the temperature must be below 50 degrees (F) to see one's breath. The phenomenon is dependent on a number of criteria, including pressure and humidity. It is possible to make one's breath visible at room temperatures by partially pressurizing your exhaled breath.",
            "There's no exact temperature at which condensation will occur. Many environmental factors other than temperature can play a role in condensation, including relative humidity (the amount of moisture in the air). When it falls below 45\u00b0 F (7.22\u00b0 C), though, you can usually expect to be able to see your breath."

Years to maturity: The number of years remaining before the bond reaches its maturity date. The maturity is the date the par or face value of the bond is returned to the bond holder.",

            "This Elderberry Syrup Recipe is a great way to keep your family healthy and happy while saving pennies too! Elderberries (also know as sambucus or sambucol) have long been used in folk medicine to prevent and treat the symptoms of the common cold and flu. These tiny purple-blue berries are rich in anti-oxidant flavinoids and anti-inflammatory anthocyanin.",
            "Pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take elderberry. If you have an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, you should ask your doctor before taking elderberry, as it may stimulate the immune system.",
            "In the Wikipedia entry on elderberries, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elderberry, it says: I'm going to try the elderberry tea. Then I'll know it's cooked, and I can control the amount of sugar, if any, in it.",
            "1 Add all ingredients except for the honey into a medium saucepan. 2  Bring to a boil, and then lower heat to medium. 3  Continue simmering for 30-45 minutes until the liquid is reduced to half. 4  Before the liquid cools, strain it through a fine mesh strainer.",
            "Take 1-2 teaspoons daily during cold and flu season (taking an occasional break for a day or two), increasing as needed if you start to feel rundown. While it\u2019s great on a spoon, we also like to drizzle elderberry syrup over french toast or swirl it into homemade yogurt.",
            "Elderberry is available as a liquid, syrup, and tincture, as well as in capsule and lozenge forms. Dried elder flower is usually standardized to at least 0.8% flavonoids. Sambucol is standardized to 38% elderberry extract for adults and 19% for children.",
            "Elderberry, or elder, has been used for centuries to treat wounds, when applied to the skin. It is also taken by mouth to treat respiratory illnesses such as cold and flu. In many countries, including Germany, elder flower is used to treat colds and flu.",
            "Drugs that suppress the immune system -- Because elderberry may stimulate the immune system, it could interfere with medications taken to suppress the immune system. These medications include corticosteroids (prednisone) and medications used to treat autoimmune diseases.",
            "There's impressive medical research on the effectiveness of elderberry in strengthening the immune system and helping to combat influenza, etc. But I can't find anything on its safety during pregnancy; everything seems to have the usual disclaimer, if pregnant or nursing, consult your physician.."
