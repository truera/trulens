The Earth's lithosphere is composed of seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates.","Divergent boundaries are where the plates move away from each other and new crust is created. Mid-ocean ridges are an example of divergent boundaries. Convergent boundaries are where the plates collide with one another causing the subduction of one plate beneath the other.","Tectonics (from the Late Latin tectonicus from the Greek τεκτονικός, pertaining to building ) is concerned with the processes which control the structure and properties of the Earth's crust, and its evolution through time.","From the deepest ocean trench to the tallest mountain, plate tectonics explains the features and movement of Earth's surface in the present and the past. Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. The plates act like a hard and rigid shell compared to Earth's mantle. This strong outer layer is called the lithosphere.","Wegener didn't have an explanation for how continents could move around the planet, but researchers do now. Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology, said Nicholas van der Elst, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York.","The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone. Although subduction is believed to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted.","By definition the word plate in geologic terms means a large slab of solid rock. Tectonics is a part of the Greek root for to build and together the terms define how the Earth's surface is built up of moving plates. The theory of plate tectonics itself says that the Earth's lithosphere is made up individual plates that are broken down into over a dozen large and small pieces of solid rock.","The driving force behind plate tectonics is convection in the mantle. Hot material near the Earth's core rises, and colder mantle rock sinks. It's kind of like a pot boiling on a stove, Van der Elst said.","History of Plate Tectonics. Plate tectonics grew out of a theory that was first developed in the early 20th century by the meteorologist Alfred Wegener. In 1912, Wegener noticed that the coastlines of the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa seemed to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.","Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries.

When the oil foams, hydrostatic processes diminish or stop, and so does the tractor.","Theoretically, the maximum power a hydrostatic transmission can transmit is a function of flow and pressure. However, in constant-power transmissions with variable output speeds, theoretical power divided by the torque/speed ratio determines actual power output.","The primary function of any hydrostatic transmission (HST) is to accept rotary power from a prime mover (usually an internal combustion engine) having specific operating characteristics and transmit that energy to a load having its own operating characteristics.","So, I'm thinking that the bottom line is this..

The operating principle of HSTs is simple: a pump, connected to the prime mover, generates flow to drive a hydraulic motor, which is connected to the load. If the displacement of the pump and motor are fixed, the HST simply acts as a gearbox to transmit power from the prime mover to the load.","Hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies incompressible fluids at rest. It encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics, which is the study of all fluids, incompressible or not, at rest. Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics, the engineering of equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids.","For example, the absolute pressure compared to vacuum is: where H is the total height of the liquid column above the test area to the surface, and p atm is the atmospheric pressure, i.e., the pressure calculated from the remaining integral over the air column from the liquid surface to infinity.","While one takes a belt form the engine to control a hydraulic pump to drive the wheels and the other takes a belt to drive a varying wheel to drive the wheel like a CVT transmission in a car. I understand the belt and pulley automatic is far less complicated.","The combined case drains flow to the reservoir through a heat exchanger. One of the most important components in a closed-circuit HST is a charge pump. The charge pump is usually an integral part of the main pump package but can also be an independent pump gang-mounted with the drive pumps it serves, Figure 6.","In a fluid at rest, all frictional stresses vanish and the state of stress of the system is called hydrostatic.

Three types of diffusion are distinguished, viz., molecular, Brownian, and turbulent.","The net diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane from the side of high water concentration to the side of low water concentration is termed osmosis.

Diffusion is a consequence of the constant thermal motion of atoms, molecules, and particles, and results in material moving from areas of high to low concentration.","Diffusion and passive transport: Molecules are in constant motion, moving around randomly (Brownian movement). One result of this random motion is diffusion, the net movement of molecules from an area where their concentration is high to an area where their concentration is lower.","Remember the definition of diffusion.

Fire intensity is influenced by environmental conditions, such as fuel load (amount of leaf and grass litter), litter moisture, litter size, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed, as well as the firing technique used.","Fire Intensity and Severity. Fire severity is a measure of the physical change in an area caused by burning (Sousa 1984). Although fire intensity is a key component of burn severity, these are two distinct features of fire; the terms are often incorrectly interchanged. Used correctly, fire intensity refers to the rate at which a fire produces heat at the flaming front and should be expressed in terms of temperature or heat yield. Fire severity, on the other hand, describes the immediate effects of fire on vegetation, litter, or soils.","Fire intensity table. Fire intensity, expressed in kilowatts per metre (kW/m), is the amount of energy released from each metre of headfire edge. One kW/m is equivalent to the energy released by a small bar radiator. Fire intensity depends upon how much fuel is burnt and how fast it burns.","It is a. function of the duration of the fire, and relates closely to the amount of surface. fuel, litter and duff consumption, and their moisture content.

Fire intensity (I) represents the heat released per meter of fire front (kW/m of fire front). It is a function of (1) heat yield of fuel (kilojoules/kg), (2) amount of fuel per unit area (kg/m2) and (3) the rate of forward spread of fire front (km/h).","Byram (1959) defined the term as the rate of energy or heat release per unit time, per unit length of fire front, regardless of its depth. However, to avoid confusion with related terms, we suggest the specific term fireline intensity when referring to Byrams definition.","The rate of energy or heat release per unit length of fire front, regardless of its depth (Byram 1959). Fireline intensity is synonymous with the terms Byram's fire intensity (Byram 1959) and frontal fire intensity. It is the numerical product of a fire's rate of spread, fuel consumption, and heat yield at a given point on a fires perimeter. Reaction intensity and total fire flux are examples of other measures of fire intensity. Units.","In addition, more fuel means larger flames and greater fire intensity. Fire behaviour is affected by the moisture content of fuels, which in turn depends on a number of factors such as weather conditions, vegetation types and whether the fuel is dead or living.","Effects of Timing of Fire and Fire Intensity. Fire frequency (or fire-return interval) is the most important factor with regard to how prescribed fire influences vegetation composition and structure.

Wheel bearings usually come in pairs of inner and outer bearings. They allow your wheels to turn freely over thousands of miles by cushioning the contact between the wheel and the spindle it sits on with frictionless bearings and lots of nice, gooey grease.","Holy ****, replacing a wheel bearing is one of the simplest and cheapest things you can do. Here's what'll happen if you don't... it'll overheat so bad that it will weld itself to the spindle. You'll know this when you're tooling along and it starts making a screaming noise and you smell and see smoke.","The car is making a roaring sound while driving and when you turn the wheel to the right, the sound gets loader.

This is often quoted as width at distance or in degrees. For example, 300ft@1000yrds would mean when the optics are focused at an object 1000 yards away, the width of the entire image as seen through the optics is 300 feet wide.","You simply divide the magnification of the binocular into the diameter of the objective lens or bottom lens of the binocular or spotting scope. So, a 7x35 binocular has an exit pupil diameter of 5 mm (35 divided by 7). A 10x50 binocular also has an exit pupil of 5 mm (50 divided by 10).","What Do the Numbers Mean on Binoculars? When shopping for a pair of binoculars, it's easy to get focused on the highest magnification. However, higher magnifications decrease your field of view. This is why it is important to understand the numbers on binoculars in order to find the right pair for you. The first number you see represents the magnification. If a pair of binoculars is 10x25, then 10 is the magnification. It's easy to assume that 10x25 means that 10 is multiplied by 25.","All binoculars are described by using a pair of numbers, such as 7×50 or 8×30. The first number, including the x, represents magnification or “power”. This tells the degree to which the object observed is enlarged. For example, a 7x binocular makes an object appear seven times closer than when viewed by the naked eye.","All binoculars will have two numbers to designate them, such as 10x50. This means a binocular with 10 times magnification and 50mm objective lenses (the big ones!). Common sizes are 8x42, 10x50, 20x60, 15x70, etc. Optical glass is generally BAK4 or BAK7 standard, BAK4 is denser and gives superior vision.","The second number refers to the objective lens diameter in millimeters. In the 10x25 example, 25 is the size of the objective lens. The objective lens is the lens that is pointed toward the subject. It gathers light to make the images brighter. The size of the objective lens determines the size of the binoculars.","If you divide the objective lens diameter by the magnification, you will get a number approximately between 4 and 8. This number is called the exit pupil, and represents the diameter of the beam of light that leaves the eyepiece when you hold a binocular with the objective pointed towards a light source.","What do the NUMBERS mean on binoculars and spotting scopes? This is the most common question about binoculars and it is a good one. You will see combinations of numbers like 7x35, 8x42, 10x50 or 7-15x35 and many more. The numbers to the left of the x always refer to how much magnification the binocular has. The number to the right of the x indicate how big the lens is at the bottom of the binocular (this is called the objective lens). So, 7x35 means this binocular magnifies objects so they appear 7 times closer.","Porro type binoculars have an angled light path and are the traditional looking binoculars. Roof prism binoculars have a straight barrel design and do not angle the light path.

One of the most common questions I get asked on my Facebook page (Fresh Eggs Daily) is how wide chicken roosting bars should be and how high off the ground they should be positioned. So here’s everything you need to know about chicken roosting bars.","Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard. Disadvantages: The mess (droppings plus scratched up plants/grass/yard) is not contained, and the droppings can end up in places like your driveway.","How to Build Chicken Perches. Chicken perches provide a place for your chickens to roost. They may spend some time on the perches in the day, but should all be there at night. Providing a safe night time perching or roosting area will ensure that your chickens will want to come home to roost each night.","Also, feeders and waterers (if you leave them in the coop overnight) should not be placed under the roosts, nor should the nesting boxes. Learn more about composting chicken manure. Width – Chicken roosting bars should be at least 2 inches wide and preferably 4 inches wide. Chickens don’t wrap their feet around a perch like wild birds do. They actually prefer to sleep flat-footed.","First, there are three ways in which you can keep chickens: 1  Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard. 2  Limited range You can make up a fence (see fence section below) which will contain them.","Eggs laid in those nesting boxes will be filthy. When chickens sleep on a roost, their manure drops down into the bedding and the hens don’t breathe in moisture and ammonia fumes all night. This is why roosts should be up high and why coops built like dog houses are a bad idea.","A roost is an elevated bar, branch or narrow plank on which chickens perch to sleep. Seeking high spots to spend the night has been part of chicken survival instincts since long before its domestication over 5000 years ago. Chickens aren’t all that fast, they lack the prowess to ward off many predators and they are sound sleepers.","Chicken Perches can be made from 2x2's, broom handles, dowel rods and natural tree limbs. Try to keep the diameter at about 2 inches for larger chickens and 1 inch for bantam size chickens. Round off any sharp edges and sand rough spots. Some people in colder climates will use 2x4's mounted with the wide side up.","The dowels should be about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Plan on at least six inches of roost per bird. In the winter they’ll huddle up for warmth, in the summer they won’t crowd so tightly together. Hens are fussy about who they sleep next to, so plenty of space will prevent squabbles."],"url":["http://venus.fandm.edu/%7Efcrawfor/coop.html","http://countrysidenetwork.com/daily/poultry/chicken-coops-housing/guide-to-chicken-roosting-bars/","http://venus.fandm.edu/%7Efcrawfor/coop.html","http://www.raising-chickens.org/chicken-perches.html","http://countrysidenetwork.com/daily/poultry/chicken-coops-housing/guide-to-chicken-roosting-bars/","http://venus.fandm.edu/%7Efcrawfor/coop.html","https://hencam.com/henblog/2014/11/roosts-for-chickens/","http://www.hgtv.com/outdoors/gardens/animals-and-wildlife/why-chickens-roost","http://www.raising-chickens.org/chicken-perches.html","https://hencam.com/henblog/2014/11/roosts-for-chickens/"]},"query":"how wide should chicken roost be","query_id":388490,"query_type":"NUMERIC","wellFormedAnswers":[]},"truncated_cells":[]},{"row_idx":392,"row":{"answers":["$15 Million"],"passages":{"is_selected":[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"passage_text":["Stephanie Seymour Net Worth is $15 Million.

Igneous rocks are formed from lava or magma. Magma is molten rock that is underground and lava is molten rock that erupts out on the surface. The two main types of igneous rocks are plutonic rocks and volcanic rocks. Plutonic rocks are formed when magma cools and solidifies underground.Volcanic rocks are formed from lava that flows on the surface of the Earth and other planets and then cools and solidifies. The texture of an igneous rock depends on the size of the crystals in the rock.This tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic. When magma cools underground, it cools very slowly and when lava cools above ground, it cools quickly. When magma and lava cool, mineral crystals start to form in the molten rock.his tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic.

(a rock that forms when magma in such intrusions solidifies underground) Take home message Molten rock underground is called magma, whereas molten rock that has come out of a vent at the Earth's surface is lava.","Magma (from Greek μάγμα, thick unguent) is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles.agma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance. Temperatures of most magmas are in the range 700 °C to 1300 °C (or 1300 °F to 2400 °F), but very rare carbonatite magmas may be as cool as 600 °C, and komatiite magmas may have been as hot as 1600 °C. Most magmas are silicate mixtures.","Extrusive igneous rock. Extrusive, or volcanic, igneous rock is produced when magma ex its and cools outside of, or very near the Earth's surface. These are the rocks that form at erupting volcanoes and oozing fissures.The magma, called lava when molten rock erupts on the surface, cools and solidifies almost instantly when it is exposed to the relatively cool temperature of the atmosphere.e can learn something about the way a rock formed from by looking carefully at the evidence preserved inside. What a rock is made of, the shapes of the grains or crystals within the rock, and how the grains or crystals fit together all provide valuable clues to help us unlock the rock's history hidden within.","This creates a volcano. When the magma cools it turns into solid rock, called extrusive igneous rock. Magma that cools underground forms solid rock called intrusive igneous rock. Areas of rock can move slowly upwards, pushed up by pressure of the rocks forming underneath. This is called uplift.Weathering breaks down rocks on the surface of the Earth.agma that cools underground forms solid rock called intrusive igneous rock.

Magma is capable of intrusion into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.agma is a complex high-temperature fluid substance. Temperatures of most magmas are in the range 700 °C to 1300 °C (or 1300 °F to 2400 °F), but very rare carbonatite magmas may be as cool as 600 °C, and komatiite magmas may have been as hot as 1600 °C.
