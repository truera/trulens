            "From the deepest ocean trench to the tallest mountain, plate tectonics explains the features and movement of Earth's surface in the present and the past. Plate tectonics is the theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. The plates act like a hard and rigid shell compared to Earth's mantle. This strong outer layer is called the lithosphere.",
            "Wegener didn't have an explanation for how continents could move around the planet, but researchers do now. Plate tectonics is the unifying theory of geology, said Nicholas van der Elst, a seismologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York.",

Although subduction is believed to be the strongest force driving plate motions, it cannot be the only force since there are plates such as the North American Plate which are moving, yet are nowhere being subducted.",
            "By definition the word plate in geologic terms means a large slab of solid rock. Tectonics is a part of the Greek root for to build and together the terms define how the Earth's surface is built up of moving plates. The theory of plate tectonics itself says that the Earth's lithosphere is made up individual plates that are broken down into over a dozen large and small pieces of solid rock.",
            "The driving force behind plate tectonics is convection in the mantle. Hot material near the Earth's core rises, and colder mantle rock sinks. It's kind of like a pot boiling on a stove, Van der Elst said.",
            "History of Plate Tectonics. Plate tectonics grew out of a theory that was first developed in the early 20th century by the meteorologist Alfred Wegener. In 1912, Wegener noticed that the coastlines of the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa seemed to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
            "Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries. The lateral relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually."

            "Another drawback is that hydrostatic processes generate a lot of heat which must be shed (hence the fan on the input pulley) or the build up of heat will lead to foaming and burning (carbonizing) of the oil inside the transmission. When the oil foams, hydrostatic processes diminish or stop, and so does the tractor.",
            "Theoretically, the maximum power a hydrostatic transmission can transmit is a function of flow and pressure. However, in constant-power transmissions with variable output speeds, theoretical power divided by the torque/speed ratio determines actual power output.",
            "The primary function of any hydrostatic transmission (HST) is to accept rotary power from a prime mover (usually an internal combustion engine) having specific operating characteristics and transmit that energy to a load having its own operating characteristics.",
            "So, I'm thinking that the bottom line is this.. The hydrostatic is great, but the good ones must have a way of changing the hydraulic fluid and the filter....And it. will be less efficient that the CVT.. The greater efficiency will come at a prive...every 2-3 years $100 to $200 for two new belts.",
            "Hydrostatic transmissions are evolving. Understanding hydrostatic transmissions. The operating principle of HSTs is simple: a pump, connected to the prime mover, generates flow to drive a hydraulic motor, which is connected to the load. If the displacement of the pump and motor are fixed, the HST simply acts as a gearbox to transmit power from the prime mover to the load.",
            "Hydrostatics is the branch of fluid mechanics that studies incompressible fluids at rest. It encompasses the study of the conditions under which fluids are at rest in stable equilibrium as opposed to fluid dynamics, the study of fluids in motion. Hydrostatics are categorized as a part of the fluid statics, which is the study of all fluids, incompressible or not, at rest. Hydrostatics is fundamental to hydraulics, the engineering of equipment for storing, transporting and using fluids.",
            "For example, the absolute pressure compared to vacuum is: where H is the total height of the liquid column above the test area to the surface, and p atm is the atmospheric pressure, i.e., the pressure calculated from the remaining integral over the air column from the liquid surface to infinity.",
            "While one takes a belt form the engine to control a hydraulic pump to drive the wheels and the other takes a belt to drive a varying wheel to drive the wheel like a CVT transmission in a car. I understand the belt and pulley automatic is far less complicated.",
            "The combined case drains flow to the reservoir through a heat exchanger. One of the most important components in a closed-circuit HST is a charge pump. The charge pump is usually an integral part of the main pump package but can also be an independent pump gang-mounted with the drive pumps it serves, Figure 6.",
            "In a fluid at rest, all frictional stresses vanish and the state of stress of the system is called hydrostatic. When this condition of (V=0) is applied to the Navier-Stokes equation, the gradient of pressure becomes a function of body forces only."

This deal, known as the Louisiana Purchase, nearly doubled the size of the United States.",

They thought that Thomas Jefferson didn't have the right to make such a large purchase of land and that we would soon be at war with Spain over the land. The purchase was nearly cancelled by Congress and only passed by the vote of 59-57.",
            "Therefore, Jefferson sent envoys to France to try and secure its purchase. Instead, they returned with an agreement to buy the entire Louisiana Territory. America did not have the money to pay the $15 million outright so they instead borrowed the money from Great Britain at 6% interest.",

It is thus important in biology and medicine, chemistry and geology, engineering and physics, and in just about every aspect of our lives. Diffusion is a consequence of the constant thermal motion of atoms, molecules, and particles, and results in material moving from areas of high to low concentration.",

            "RE: Does your temperature rise/drop before or after your period? I am charting my basal temp for the first time this month. I know that my temp rises 1-2 days after ovulation. But I am wondering when the menstral change occurs-before or after my period and does it rise or fall?",
            "Relax: Excellent that you monitor your B/P. The change you are noticing is a slight variant but normal reflection of the hormonal influences on your blood pressure during your cycle. The diastolic, (second number), is the most important long term and you should seek care if it routinely goes above 90 to 100.",
            "Before ovulation, early morning temperatures typically range from about 97 degrees to 97.5 degrees Fahrenheit (36.11 to 36.38 degrees Celsius), and after ovulation, they usually rise to about 97.6 degrees to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (36.44 to 37 Celsius).",
            "It\u2019s helpful to use a special basal or digital thermometer to get readings that are precise enough to track such small changes. After ovulation, your temperature usually remains elevated until your next period, about two weeks later. But if you become pregnant, it remains high for more than 18 days. The important concept to understand is your pattern of low and high temperatures. Your temperatures before ovulation fluctuate in a low range, and the temperatures after ovulation fluctuate in a higher range.",
            "Best Answer: It really depends upon the person. Your temp will fall, but some women experience a gradual fall a few days before...others may see a drop the day OF, the day BEFORE, etc. It really depends. You can't bank on post-ovulatory temps, alone, to determine if you are pregnant. It just doesn't work that way.",

            "1 The time from a woman\u2019s period until ovulation varies, but it is often about two weeks. 2  Sperm can live in fertile-quality cervical fluid for up to five days, though typically they live only about two days.",
            "The easiest way to estimate when you'll ovulate is to count back. First, figure out what day your next period will probably start. (If your period is very irregular, this method won't work for you.). From that day, count back 12 days and then another four. You're most likely to ovulate during this five-day range. If you're one of the many women who have a 28-day cycle, there's a good chance you\u2019ll ovulate on day 14. (Day 1 is the first day of your period; day 28 is the last day before day 1 of your next period.). Get help counting the days.",
            "About a week or so before my period starts, during my period and sometimes a few days after ,I run a temperature that ranges 99 - 100. 4. Get help from a doctor now \u203a. It's normal: This is a normal component of the menstrual cycle.",
            "(Your basal body temperature, or BBT, is your lowest body temperature in a 24-hour period.) This tiny uptick is only 0.4 to 1.0 degree Fahrenheit. You can detect it by taking your BBT every morning with a special thermometer."

            "The processes by which the sediment becomes lithified into a hard sedimentary rock is called diagenesis and includes all physical, chemical and biological processes that act on the sediment. The first step in diagenesis is the compaction of the sediment and loss of water as a result of the weight of the overlying sediment. Compaction and burial may cause recrystallization of the minerals to make the rock even harder.",

The first stage of the process is compaction. Compaction occurs as the weight of the overlying material increases. Compaction forces the grains closer together, reducing pore space and eliminating some of the contained water. Some of this water may carry mineral components in solution, and these constituents may later precipitate as new minerals in the pore spaces."

Dry eyes may be caused by age, overuse of the eye, or certain medications. Eye strain is also caused by overuse of the eyes, but it can also be caused by vision problems. Eye strain and dry eyes are very treatable, so talk to an eye doctor about symptoms for relief. Nutritional imbalances may also lead to eyebrow twitching.",

            "Updated June 30, 2016. Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant is born with some or all of his/her intestines on the outside of the abdomen due to an abnormal opening in the abdominal muscle. The opening can range from small to large, and in some cases other organs can also protrude through the hole. Young mothers who use recreational drugs early in pregnancy or who smoke have a higher risk of having an infant born with gastroschisis, but in many cases, it is not known what causes the disorder.",
            "Infants suspected of having pyloric stenosis usually undergo blood tests because the continuous vomiting of stomach acid, as well as the resulting dehydration from fluid losses, can cause salt and other imbalances in the blood that need to be corrected.",
            "This article is about birth in humans. For birth in other mammals, see birth. Childbirth, also known as labour and delivery, is the ending of a pregnancy by one or more babies leaving a woman's uterus. In 2015 there were about 135 million births globally. About 15 million were born before 37 weeks of gestation, while between 3 and 12% were born after 42 weeks.",

            "Pyloric stenosis, a condition that may affect the gastrointestinal tract during infancy, isn't normal \u2014 it can cause your baby to vomit forcefully and often and may cause other problems such as dehydration and salt and fluid imbalances. Immediate treatment for pyloric stenosis is extremely important.",
            "Abdominal wall surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is a procedure that improves the appearance of flabby, stretched-out abdominal (belly) muscles and skin. It is often called a tummy tuck. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery. Abdominal wall surgery is not the same as liposuction, which is another way to remove fat. But abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction.",
            "In brief: Birth anatomy. Your question needs slightly more info. There is a term called malrotation and deals with abnormal rotation of the blood vessels an the small intestine and colon. Another possibility is if there is a defect of the diaphragm that allow the stomach to come through and twist. Ultimately it is usually an abnormal rotation of the intestines and blood supply. Can't be prevented or foreseen.",
            "Any dehydration or electrolyte problems in the blood will be corrected with intravenous (IV) fluids, usually within 24 hours. A surgical procedure called pyloromyotomy, which involves cutting through the thickened muscles of the pylorus, is performed to relieve the blockage that results from pyloric stenosis. The pylorus is examined through a very small incision, and the muscles that are overgrown and thickened are spread and relaxed.",

It is generally closely linked to the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit and/or obstetric surgery unit if present."

Although fire intensity is a key component of burn severity, these are two distinct features of fire; the terms are often incorrectly interchanged. Used correctly, fire intensity refers to the rate at which a fire produces heat at the flaming front and should be expressed in terms of temperature or heat yield. Fire severity, on the other hand, describes the immediate effects of fire on vegetation, litter, or soils.",

            "The leading cause of a wheel bearing failing is its seal. The inside of a bearing can be a hot place. When a bearing is cooling off, the contracting metal, air and lubricant can create a vacuum that is hopefully held by the seals.",
            "When the seal on the wheel bearing is broken or damaged, the noise starts out very faint and becomes louder over time. It sounds like the noise that your tires make when hitting a rumble strip on the highway, just not quite as loud, something like the sound of playing cards flapping against bicycle spokes.",
            "If you just want to check your wheel bearings for wear without removing the wheels, do the following: 1  Jack up your vehicle. Support it on jack stands. 2  Without getting under the vehicle, grasp each wheel at the top and bottom and attempt to rock it. There should be minimal movement.",
            "So I drive a ****box 89 Sunbird. The RF wheel bearing has been going bad over the past few months, but I don't know exactly when to pull the plug and say it's not safe to drive it anymore. All it's done is make a humming noise at speeds >40mph. There doesn't seem to be any play in the tire, and the car doesn't shake or pull (much).",
            "You can check your car\u2019s wheel bearings to see if they need to be repacked. Wheel bearings usually come in pairs of inner and outer bearings. They allow your wheels to turn freely over thousands of miles by cushioning the contact between the wheel and the spindle it sits on with frictionless bearings and lots of nice, gooey grease.",
            "Holy ****, replacing a wheel bearing is one of the simplest and cheapest things you can do. Here's what'll happen if you don't... it'll overheat so bad that it will weld itself to the spindle. You'll know this when you're tooling along and it starts making a screaming noise and you smell and see smoke.",
            "The car is making a roaring sound while driving and when you turn the wheel to the right, the sound gets loader. There also a bit of a vibration in the gas pedal. We changed the driver side wheel bearing and there is no change. We also over inflated the tires to see if the noise was the tires and there was no change.",

            "On a car, a wheel bearing rides on a metal axle shaft and fits tightly inside the hub, which is a hollow chunk of metal at the center of the wheel. The hub holds the lug bolts that you use to bolt the tire onto the wheel. The wheel bearing is pressed into the hub from the back.",
            "Most serviceable wheel bearings need maintenance every 25,000 to 30,000 miles, or during every brake service. But, the average life of a sealed wheel bearing and hub assembly is about 85,000 to 100,000 miles, without the opportunity for you to repack the bearings."

            "FOV stands for Field-of-View and it is the width of the image as seen through optics. This is often quoted as width at distance or in degrees. For example, 300ft@1000yrds would mean when the optics are focused at an object 1000 yards away, the width of the entire image as seen through the optics is 300 feet wide.",
            "You simply divide the magnification of the binocular into the diameter of the objective lens or bottom lens of the binocular or spotting scope. So, a 7x35 binocular has an exit pupil diameter of 5 mm (35 divided by 7). A 10x50 binocular also has an exit pupil of 5 mm (50 divided by 10).",
            "What Do the Numbers Mean on Binoculars? When shopping for a pair of binoculars, it's easy to get focused on the highest magnification. However, higher magnifications decrease your field of view. This is why it is important to understand the numbers on binoculars in order to find the right pair for you. The first number you see represents the magnification. If a pair of binoculars is 10x25, then 10 is the magnification. It's easy to assume that 10x25 means that 10 is multiplied by 25.",
            "All binoculars are described by using a pair of numbers, such as 7\u00d750 or 8\u00d730. The first number, including the x, represents magnification or \u201cpower\u201d. This tells the degree to which the object observed is enlarged. For example, a 7x binocular makes an object appear seven times closer than when viewed by the naked eye.",
            "All binoculars will have two numbers to designate them, such as 10x50. This means a binocular with 10 times magnification and 50mm objective lenses (the big ones!). Common sizes are 8x42, 10x50, 20x60, 15x70, etc. Optical glass is generally BAK4 or BAK7 standard, BAK4 is denser and gives superior vision.",
            "The second number refers to the objective lens diameter in millimeters. In the 10x25 example, 25 is the size of the objective lens. The objective lens is the lens that is pointed toward the subject. It gathers light to make the images brighter. The size of the objective lens determines the size of the binoculars.",
            "If you divide the objective lens diameter by the magnification, you will get a number approximately between 4 and 8. This number is called the exit pupil, and represents the diameter of the beam of light that leaves the eyepiece when you hold a binocular with the objective pointed towards a light source.",
            "What do the NUMBERS mean on binoculars and spotting scopes? This is the most common question about binoculars and it is a good one. You will see combinations of numbers like 7x35, 8x42, 10x50 or 7-15x35 and many more. The numbers to the left of the x always refer to how much magnification the binocular has. The number to the right of the x indicate how big the lens is at the bottom of the binocular (this is called the objective lens). So, 7x35 means this binocular magnifies objects so they appear 7 times closer.",
            "Porro type binoculars have an angled light path and are the traditional looking binoculars. Roof prism binoculars have a straight barrel design and do not angle the light path. Contrary to what you may think, the roof prism type of binoculars typically cost more to produce than porros.",

            "First, there are three ways in which you can keep chickens: 1  Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. 2  Limited range You can make up a fence (see fence section below) which will contain them. 3  Completely housed (in a coop) Advantages: Safety.",
            "Lisa Steele \u2022 March 1, 2017. One of the most common questions I get asked on my Facebook page (Fresh Eggs Daily) is how wide chicken roosting bars should be and how high off the ground they should be positioned. So here\u2019s everything you need to know about chicken roosting bars.",
            "Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard. Disadvantages: The mess (droppings plus scratched up plants/grass/yard) is not contained, and the droppings can end up in places like your driveway.",
            "How to Build Chicken Perches. Chicken perches provide a place for your chickens to roost. They may spend some time on the perches in the day, but should all be there at night. Providing a safe night time perching or roosting area will ensure that your chickens will want to come home to roost each night.",
            "Also, feeders and waterers (if you leave them in the coop overnight) should not be placed under the roosts, nor should the nesting boxes. Learn more about composting chicken manure. Width \u2013 Chicken roosting bars should be at least 2 inches wide and preferably 4 inches wide. Chickens don\u2019t wrap their feet around a perch like wild birds do. They actually prefer to sleep flat-footed.",
            "First, there are three ways in which you can keep chickens: 1  Free range Advantages: It's fun and you get to see the chickens run all around. They also eat healthy stuff (and bugs) in the yard. 2  Limited range You can make up a fence (see fence section below) which will contain them.",
            "Eggs laid in those nesting boxes will be filthy. When chickens sleep on a roost, their manure drops down into the bedding and the hens don\u2019t breathe in moisture and ammonia fumes all night. This is why roosts should be up high and why coops built like dog houses are a bad idea.",
            "A roost is an elevated bar, branch or narrow plank on which chickens perch to sleep. Seeking high spots to spend the night has been part of chicken survival instincts since long before its domestication over 5000 years ago. Chickens aren\u2019t all that fast, they lack the prowess to ward off many predators and they are sound sleepers.",
            "Chicken Perches can be made from 2x2's, broom handles, dowel rods and natural tree limbs. Try to keep the diameter at about 2 inches for larger chickens and 1 inch for bantam size chickens. Round off any sharp edges and sand rough spots. Some people in colder climates will use 2x4's mounted with the wide side up.",
            "The dowels should be about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Plan on at least six inches of roost per bird. In the winter they\u2019ll huddle up for warmth, in the summer they won\u2019t crowd so tightly together. Hens are fussy about who they sleep next to, so plenty of space will prevent squabbles."

            "1937 -- Asteroid Hermes -- about a kilometer in diameter -- misses Earth by 600,000 miles. Hermes, although smaller than the 'roid that snuffed the dinosaurs, could have been a true category killer, able to cause epic devastation and kill millions.",
            "Ever since the Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, it has been bombarded with rocks from space. Each year about 50,000 tons of asteroidal material enters the Earths atmosphere.",
            "An asteroid impact is also the stuff of science fact. There are obvious craters on Earth (and the moon) that show us a long history of large objects hitting the planet. The most famous asteroid ever is the one that hit Earth 65 million years ago. It's thought that this asteroid threw so much moisture and dust in to the atmosphere that it cut off sunlight, lowering temperatures worldwide and causing the extinction of the dinosaurs.",
            "The key to this trick is time. The Earth is 8,000 miles across, so at most you have to move the asteroid 4,000 miles to make it miss. If you have, say, two years of advance warning you need only change the velocity of the rock by one-fifth of a mile per hour to make it miss. That\u2019s far less than walking speed!",
            "Here's a typical example. In 2028, the asteroid 1997XF11 will come extremely close to Earth but will miss the planet. If something were to change and it did hit Earth, what you would have is a mile-wide asteroid striking the planet's surface at about 30,000 mph. An asteroid that big traveling at that speed has the energy roughly equal to a 1 million megaton bomb.",
            "We now believe there are between 500 and 1,000 near-Earth asteroids larger than one kilometer in diameter.. 2000 -- Michael Paine, an Australian engineer, announces a new computer analysis of asteroid impacts indicating that asteroids may cause considerable chaos over a 100,000-year period.",
            "2000 -- NASA's Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking System announces new data about large asteroids. Until now, scientists thought the population of large, near-Earth asteroids was between 1,000 and 2,000, but we've downgraded that number significantly, said David Rabinowitz, now at Yale University.",
            "Big impacts are rare. The Chelyabinsk asteroid was 19 meters (62 feet) in diameter, and, on average, we should expect an impact from an object that size somewhere on Earth about once every 25 years. (Because most of the planet is covered in water, many of these go unnoticed.) A small chunk of Chelyabinsk meteorite, given to me by a friend.",
            "Now we have the assertion, based on a computer simulation by Australian engineer Michael Paine, that during the last 10,000 years, Earth was hit about 350 times by asteroids as large as the rock that wasted 2,000 square kilometers of Siberian forest in 1908.",
            "A particular concern was tsunamis. When an asteroid hits the ocean, which covers about 70 percent of the planet, it can trigger a tsunami. According to the simulation, the average tsunami would kill 470,000 people."

The two main types of igneous rocks are plutonic rocks and volcanic rocks. Plutonic rocks are formed when magma cools and solidifies underground.Volcanic rocks are formed from lava that flows on the surface of the Earth and other planets and then cools and solidifies. The texture of an igneous rock depends on the size of the crystals in the rock.This tells us if the rock is plutonic or volcanic.
