The most expensive patents are international patents, which can run up to $100,000 or higher. Domestically the costs can be $10,000 or above. Patent applications involve lots of text and drawings, even for simpler inventions. The first step in the patent application process is to file a non provisional patent application, which involves paying attorney fees in the range of $5000 to $15,000 or more, depending on the intricacies of the invention.

Metabolic acidosis should be considered a sign of an underlying disease process. Identification of this underlying condition is essential to initiate appropriate therapy.

In these instances, pH may not be reduced or the HCO 3 - concentration may not be low.",

Metabolic acidosis can indicate a more serious problem with a major organ like the liver, heart, or kidneys. In compensated acidosis pH may be normal, with a high blood bicarbonate concentration (due to increased renal retention) when the cause was respiratory, or with a low blood carbon dioxide (due to hyperventilation) when the cause was metabolic. See also glycolysis, lactic acid.",
                        "Acidosis is a serious metabolic imbalance in which there is an excess of acidic molecules in the body. This can occur as a result of acid overproduction, impaired acid transport, acid underexcretion, or any combination. With overproduction, the body makes too much acid. This can occur in sepsis, a life-threatening widespread infection in which the body makes too much lactic acid. With underexcretion, the body is unable to rid itself of excess acid. This can occur in renal failure and various lung diseases. In renal failure, the kidneys are unable to cleanse the blood of acid.",

                        "Pumice is a light-colored, extremely porous igneous rock that forms during explosive volcanic eruptions. It is used as aggregate in lightweight concrete, as landscaping aggregate, and as an abrasive in a variety of industrial and consumer products. The second most powerful volcanic eruption of the 20th century was at Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The description below explains how enormous volumes of dissolved gas powered the eruption and how a cubic mile of ash and pumice lapilli was blasted from the volcano.",
                        "There are four major groups of the igneous rocks: basalt, andesite, dacite and rhyolite. Each of these different rock groups form different types of volcanoes. Volcanic rocks forming during eruption of Kilauea, USGS. Rhyolite rocks. Rhyolite magma cooling underground forms granite. Granite has large interlocking crystals that can be easily seen if you hold the rock at arm's length. Rhyolite is associated super volcanoes and explosive volcanic eruptions that create calderas. Basalt rocks. Basalt rocks are formed from dark heavy lava that usually forms in the upper mantle. Pillow basalt covers all the ocean floors. It forms when lava erupts on the ocean floor at spreading ridges where two crustal plates are separating.",
                        "The effects of the eruption were felt worldwide. It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes (1.1 × 10 10 short tons) or 10 km 3 (2.4 cu mi) of magma, and 20,000,000 tonnes (22,000,000 short tons) SO 2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and metals to the surface environment. It injected more particulate into the stratosphere than any eruption since Krakatoa in 1883. Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze. Global temperatures dropped by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) in the years 1991-93, and ozone depletion temporarily increased substantially",
                        "Basalt and granite actually have quite a bit in common. Both are igneous rocks, which means that they cooled from a magma (the earth gets very hot just below the surface, and there is lots of liquid rock available). Both are made up of minerals from the silicate group, so both have large amounts of silicon and oxygen. Granite is the ultimate silicate rock. As discussed elsewhere in greater detail, on average oxygen and silicon account for 75% of the earth's crust. The remaining 25% is split among several other elements, with aluminum and potassium contributing the most to the formation of the continental granitic rocks.",
                        "Mount Pinatubo is a volcano on the island of Luzon in the  Philippines. It is best known for its enormous eruption on June 15,  1991. This eruption was the second largest of … the twentieth  century. 1 person found this useful. Similar to many other volcanoes it has a large assortment or rocks, a lot of granite as these rocks are carried out from the magma chamber. … There are other rocks such as basalt, Scoria, sandstone, mudstone, shale, limestone, quartize, hornfels, slate and marble. 4 people",
                        "Mount Pinatubo (Filipino: Bundok Pinatubo) is an active stratovolcano in the Cabusilan Mountains on the island of Luzon, near the tripoint of the Philippine provinces of Zambales, Tarlac, and Pampanga. Before the volcanic activities of 1991, its eruptive history was unknown to most people. It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes (1.1 × 10 10 short tons) or 10 km 3 (2.4 cu mi) of magma, and 20,000,000 tonnes (22,000,000 short tons) SO 2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and metals to the surface environment.

The lava when it flows out a a volcano vent is so sticky that it piles on top of a volcano's vent forming a dome. Lava domes often form in the craters of stratovolcanoes like Mount Saint Helens. Basalt rocks. Basalt rocks are formed from dark heavy lava that usually forms in the upper mantle. Pillow basalt covers all the ocean floors. It forms when lava erupts on the ocean floor at spreading ridges where two crustal plates are separating.",
                        "Today, ancestral Pinatubo is exposed in relict walls of an old 3.5x4.5-km caldera, recognized by Delfin (1983, 1984) and named here the Tayawan caldera (fig. 3). Prominent points on the relict rim of that caldera include Mount Donald Macdonald (southeast caldera rim) and Mount Tayawan (north-northeast caldera rim). Radiocarbon ages suggest that eruptions from the modern Pinatubo have been clustered in at least six and possibly as many as a dozen eruptive periods. Each eruptive period is short in relation to intervening repose periods (table 1, fig. 5). Each of these six eruptive periods of modern Mount Pinatubo is described below.",

As noted earlier, these rocks form above active subduction zones on both continental and oceanic plates. Eruptions typically result in the construction of large, steep-sided, composite or strato volcanoes made up of alternating lava flows and pyroclastic (ash) deposits.",

After surgery, bile flows from the liver (where it is made) through the common bile duct and into the small intestine. Because the gallbladder has been removed, the body can no longer store bile between meals. What To Think About. Recovery is much faster and less painful after laparoscopic surgery than after open surgery. 1  The hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery is shorter than after open surgery. 2  People generally go home the same day or the next day, compared with 2 to 4 days or longer for open surgery.",

Cholecystectomy may be performed within days to weeks after hospitalization for an acute gallbladder attack, depending on the severity of the condition. 1  Emergency gallbladder removal within 24 - 48 hours is warranted in about 20% of patients with acute cholecystitis.

Symptoms usually do not return after the gallbladder has been removed. In a small number of cases, surgery may be done to prevent complications of gallstones. Laparoscopic surgery is often the best method to remove the gallbladder. Open gallbladder surgery requires a longer recovery period and causes more pain. Surgery may be done for: 1  Gallstones that cause symptoms.",

After open surgery, you will have to stay three to five days in hospital and your recovery time will be longer.

                        "In later years, when he was referred to as the Father of the Constitution, Madison protested that the document was not the off-spring of a single brain, but the work of many heads and many hands.. In Congress, he helped frame the Bill of Rights and enact the first revenue legislation.",
                        "James Madison was called the father of the constitution because  he was the author of the basic plan of government that the  Convention adopted. Not only that, but he kept … careful notes at  Convention which was not open to the public. These notes are by far  the best record of the convention in existence.",
                        "James Madison is generally regarded as the father of the United States Constitution. No other delegate was better prepared for the Federal Convention of 1787, and no one contributed more than Madison to shaping the ideas and contours of the document or to explaining its meaning."

In this section, we will look at the costs of the various components of a solar system (not installation or operational costs). Solar Panels. The solar panels themselves usually account for about 30% of total costs. Residential solar panels with a combined capacity of 3-8kW typically cost between $4,000-$16,000. The best solar panels are not necessarily the most expensive.",

Schedule a free consultation with one of our knowledgeable consultants to learn about the price of a solar panel system for your home and how much you can save every month on your electricity bills. The initial call will be about 10 minutes. Our residential solar power systems are custom designed for your home. Getting a solar panel system price estimate is easy: you can start with a quick online quote, talk with one of our friendly consultants or request a free consultation and written proposal.",

                        "The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes. The total price of a system, of course, varies tremendously based on the size of your roof and your electricity needs. I got a quote for my 2,000 square foot house in the Dallas area and it was $85,000 installed. Financed over 30 years that comes out to $509/month. My electric bill is about $140/month on average. So over 30 years solar would cost over $100,000 more than electricity from the grid (gas, coal, wind).",
                        "The cost of home solar panels depends on the size of the system that you need. As of June 2011, one company offered a medium-sized system capable of generating 480 KWh per month for approximately $9,000 before the state rebates and tax incentives. You also must factor in the cost of labor to determine the cost of residential solar panels. How much the installation of the system will cost depends on the size of the panels and your home. In some cases, installation can double the cost of the system. Call local contractors who are experienced with installing solar panels for an estimate",
                        "Once these were factored in, the actual cost of the system was around $6,000 plus the cost of installation. The current federal tax credit is 30 percent of the cost of home solar panels. You will receive that back as a refund on your next year’s taxes.

Electricity rates vary, and each state has different rebates that may affect the overall price of your system. The average system costs a little over $10,000. When we installed solar, the value of our home was increased by more than the cost of the system.
