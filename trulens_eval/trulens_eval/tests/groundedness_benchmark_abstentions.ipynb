    "# ðŸ““ Groundedness Evaluations for Abstention Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, feedbacks can be thought of as LLM apps themselves. Given text, they return some result. Thinking in this way, we can use TruLens to evaluate and track our feedback quality. We can even do this for different models or prompting schemes (such as chain-of-thought reasoning).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows an evaluation of a set of test cases generated from human annotated datasets. In particular, we generate test cases from [SummEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12626).\n",
    "\n",
    "SummEval is one of the datasets dedicated to automated evaluations on summarization tasks, which are closely related to the groundedness evaluation in RAG with the retrieved context (i.e. the source) and response (i.e. the summary). It contains human annotation of numerical score (**1** to **5**) comprised of scoring from 3 human expert annotators and 5 croweded-sourced annotators. There are 16 models being used for generation in total for 100 paragraphs in the test set, so there are a total of 16,000 machine-generated summaries. Each paragraph also has several human-written summaries for comparative analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating groundedness feedback functions, we compute the annotated \"consistency\" scores, a measure of whether the summarized response is factually consisntent with the source texts and hence can be used as a proxy to evaluate groundedness in our RAG triad, and normalized to **0** to **1** score as our **expected_score** and to match the output of feedback functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstention Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular set of evaluations, we are focused on the handling of abstentions. Uncertainty-based abstention in LLMs has been shown to improve safety and reduce hallucination ([Tomani](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10960)). For groundedness evaluations, we want to ensure these are handled in a manner that is consistent with human preferences; in other words, calibrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstentions can be broken down into two distinct groups, distinguished by whether the question is answerable given the context. In other words, whether the abstention is **justified**. We take an opinionated stance that abstentions for unanswerable questions are justified and therefore, **grounded**. Alternatively, abstentions for questions answerable by the context are therefore not grounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For this set of experiments, we take the same test cases used for groundedness evaluations with a few key changes:\n",
    "1. We randomly sample approximately 50% of the test cases and replace the response with an abstention. We'll refer to this as the abstention set. The rest will be head as control.\n",
    "2. In the abstention set, we will take a random sample of approximately 50% of cases and truncate to remove all but the first sentence in the query, removing a majority of the context. This splits the absention set into **answerable** and **unanswerable** abstentions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we have two tests sets to test against.\n",
    "1. The expected score for all abstentions is 1.\n",
    "2. The expected score for answerable abstentions will be set to 0, and then the expected score for unanswerable abstentions will be set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then compute the MAE of our groundedness evaluator against the expected score for each test set. Results will be displayed for the following subgroups:\n",
    "- Abstentions v. Control\n",
    "- Answerable Abstentions v. Unanswerable Abstentions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also show results for the test cases with high and low human-annotated consistency to ensure that this treatment is consistent across expected scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Improving Groundedness\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the groundedness feedback function against these tests, we consider the following changes:\n",
    "- Abstentions are excluded from statements to evaluate; empty strings are considered grounded.\n",
    "- The answerability in abstention cases is assessed; unanswerable abstentions score high, answerable abstentions score low."

      "{'query': '(CNN)Donald Sterling\\'s racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it\\'s his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling\\'s wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple\\'s money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. \"This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,\" attorney Pierce O\\'Donnell said in a statement. \"It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts.\" Stiviano\\'s gifts from Donald Sterling didn\\'t just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling\\'s downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don\\'t have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling\\'s friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don\\'t put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said.
