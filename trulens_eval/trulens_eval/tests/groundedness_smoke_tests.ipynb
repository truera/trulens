    "## Groundedness Evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, feedbacks can be thought of as LLM apps themselves. Given text, they return some result. Thinking in this way, we can use TruLens to evaluate and track our feedback quality. We can even do this for different models (e.g. gpt-3.5 and gpt-4) or prompting schemes (such as chain-of-thought reasoning).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows an evaluation of a set of test cases generated from human annotated datasets. In particular, we generate test cases from [SummEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12626).\n",
    "\n",
    "SummEval is one of the datasets dedicated to automated evaluations on summarization tasks, which are closely related to the groundedness evaluation in RAG with the retrieved context (i.e. the source) and response (i.e. the summary). It contains human annotation of numerical score (**1** to **5**) comprised of scoring from 3 human expert annotators and 5 croweded-sourced annotators. There are 16 models being used for generation in total for 100 paragraphs in the test set, so there are a total of 16,000 machine-generated summaries. Each paragraph also has several human-written summaries for comparative analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating groundedness feedback functions, we compute the annotated \"consistency\" scores, a measure of whether the summarized resposne is factually consisntent with the source texts and hence can be used as a proxy to evaluate groundedness in our RAG triad, and normalized to **0** to **1** score as our **expected_score** and u to match the output of feedback functions."

       "[{'query': '(CNN)Donald Sterling\\'s racist remarks cost him an NBA team last year. But now it\\'s his former female companion who has lost big. A Los Angeles judge has ordered V. Stiviano to pay back more than $2.6 million in gifts after Sterling\\'s wife sued her. In the lawsuit, Rochelle \"Shelly\" Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple\\'s money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover, and that he helped her get a $1.8 million duplex. Who is V. Stiviano? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday, her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC. \"This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress,\" attorney Pierce O\\'Donnell said in a statement. \"It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts.\" Stiviano\\'s gifts from Donald Sterling didn\\'t just include uber-expensive items like luxury cars. According to the Los Angeles Times, the list also includes a $391 Easter bunny costume, a $299 two-speed blender and a $12 lace thong. Donald Sterling\\'s downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano. In the tape, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball legend Magic Johnson. \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don\\'t have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ. He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling\\'s friends can see. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don\\'t put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,\" Sterling said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league, fined him $2.5 million and pushed through a charge to terminate all of his ownership rights in the franchise.
