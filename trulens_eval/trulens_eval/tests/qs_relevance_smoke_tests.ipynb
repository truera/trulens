    "    score = relevance(\"Name some famous dental floss brands\",\"\"\"Types of floss and alternative options. Dental floss is regarded as the gold standard — it’s been around the longest compared to other plaque-removing products, Hewlett said. \n",
    "    Moursi also added that most flossing research studies have been conducted with dental floss, so there’s a lot of data showing its effectiveness. But floss is not one-size-fits-all, \n",
    "    he noted. Since using dental floss is difficult for some, there are other effective tools like interdental cleaners. Below, we broke down \n",
    "    the differences among several different options. Dental floss When people think of dental floss, it’s usually the threaded variety that comes on a spool. \n",
    "    But there’s also dental tape, which Hewlett described as a wider and flatter type of floss. He said it's particularly useful for \n",
    "    people with larger spaces between their teeth since it covers more surface area. Both forms of floss come in unflavored or flavored varieties, \n",
    "    but choosing a flavored option has no impact on how well it cleans your teeth, Hewlett said. Flosses also come waxed and unwaxed — \n",
    "    while a wax coating can make floss pass between teeth more easily, Hewitt said, both waxed and unwaxed are equally effective when used properly. \n",
    "    Floss picks Floss picks are similarly effective when compared to thread floss, experts said. The picks look like a wand and have a small piece \n",
    "    of floss at the forked end, so you can grip the handle while using the tool. Experts said floss picks are generally easy to use, especially if\n",
    "    you’re flossing a child’s teeth. Water flossers Water flossers are powered devices that shoot pressurized water at the spaces between teeth, \n",
    "    targeting debris to disrupt and flush out plaque. While there is evidence to support their ability to remove plaque from teeth, Moursi\n",
    "    said for water flossers to do their job, “you have to hold it in just the right place, at just the right angle and for just the right\n",
    "    amount of time,” which can be challenging. Anyone can use water flossers, but experts said they’re the most beneficial for people who\n",
    "    have difficulty using thread floss or floss threaders, as well as those with certain dental work like braces, bridges and crowns. \n",
    "    Interdental brushes Dental work like braces, bridges and crowns can block floss from slipping between teeth, making flossing challenging.\n",
    "    Interdental brushes — which look like little spoolie brushes — can pass through the spaces between teeth and under any dental work,\n",
    "    allowing you to remove plaque. The brushes have bristles on one end and a handle to grip on the other. To use, you point the brush at\n",

    "The rumen\n",
    "The rumen (on the left side of the animal) is the largest stomach compartment and consists of several sacs. It can hold 25 gallons or more of material depending on the size of the cow. Because of its size, the rumen acts as a storage or holding vat for feed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from storage, the rumen is also a fermentation vat. The rumen’s environment favors the growth of microbes. These microbes digest or ferment feed within the rumen and make volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The rumen absorbs most of the VFAs from fermentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good blood supply to the rumen walls improves absorption of VFAs and other digestion products. Tiny projections (papillae) line the rumen, which increases the rumen’s surface area and the amount it can absorb.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The reticulum \n",
    "The reticulum is a pouch-like structure in the forward area of the body, close to the heart. The tissues in the reticulum form a network similar to a honeycomb. A small tissue fold lies between the reticulum and rumen, but the two aren’t separate compartments. Together they’re called the rumino-reticulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heavy or dense feed and metal objects eaten by the cow drop into this compartment. Nails and other sharp objects may work into the tissue and cause “hardware disease.” You can use magnets to prevent disease or correct the problem through surgery. Leaving it untreated may lead to infection and possibly death.\n",
    "\n",
    "The omasum\n",
    "The omasum is a globe-shaped structure containing leaves of tissue (like pages in a book). It absorbs water and other substances from digestive contents. Feed material (ingesta) between the leaves will be drier than ingesta found in the other compartments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abomasum\n",
    "The abomasum is the only compartment lined with glands. These glands release hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, needed to breakdown feeds. The abomasum is similar to a nonruminant stomach.\n",

    "The small intestine consists of three sections: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. It measures about 20 times the length of the animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secretions from the pancreas and gallbladder aid in digestion within the small intestine. The small intestine completes most of the digestive process and absorbs many nutrients through villi (small finger-like projections). From the villi the nutrients enter into the blood and lymphatic systems.\n",

    "all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches. Since we were going to California, I bought a car, a yellow 1998 VW GTI. I remember thinking that its leather seats alone were by far the most luxurious thing I owned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next year, from the summer of 1998 to the summer of 1999, must have been the least productive of my life. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was worn out from the effort and stress of running Viaweb. For a while after I got to California I tried to continue my usual m.o. of programming till 3 in the morning, but fatigue combined with Yahoo's prematurely aged culture and grim cube farm in Santa Clara gradually dragged me down. After a few months it felt disconcertingly like working at Interleaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yahoo had given us a lot of options when they bought us. At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this. My brain had been entirely full of software and men's shirts for 4 years. But I had done this to get rich so I could paint, I reminded myself, and now I was rich, so I should go paint.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I said I was leaving, my boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with me about my plans. I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me. This was the height of the Internet Bubble, and Yahoo was ground zero of it. My boss was at that moment a billionaire. Leaving then to start a new startup must have seemed to him an insanely, and yet also plausibly, ambitious plan.\n",

    "But I really was quitting to paint, and I started immediately. There was no time to lose. I'd already burned 4 years getting rich. Now when I talk to founders who are leaving after selling their companies, my advice is always the same: take a vacation. That's what I should have done, just gone off somewhere and done nothing for a month or two, but the idea never occurred to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I tried to paint, but I just didn't seem to have any energy or ambition. Part of the problem was that I didn't know many people in California. I'd compounded this problem by buying a house up in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with a beautiful view but miles from anywhere. I stuck it out for a few more months, then in desperation I went back to New York, where unless you understand about rent control you'll be surprised to hear I still had my apartment, sealed up like a tomb of my old life. Idelle was in New York at least, and there were other people trying to paint there, even though I didn't know any of them.\n",

    "When I got back to New York I resumed my old life, except now I was rich. It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted\n",

But eggs – which are just female sex cells – evolved more than a billion years ago, whereas chickens have been around for just 10,000 years. So the riddle is easily solved…or is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken at face value, there is no doubt that the egg came before the chicken. We tend to think of eggs as the shelled orbs laid by birds from which their chicks hatch – unless we eat them first. But all sexually reproducing species make eggs (the specialised female sex cells). That’s 99.99 per cent of all eukaryotic life – meaning organisms that have cells with a nucleus, so all animals and plants, and everything but the simplest life forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t know for sure when sex evolved but it could have been as much as 2 billion years ago, and certainly more than 1 billion. Even the specialised sort of eggs laid by birds, with their tough outer membrane, evolved more than 300 million years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for chickens, they came into being much later. They are domesticated animals, so evolved as the result of humans purposefully selecting the least aggressive wild birds and letting them breed. This seems to have happened in several places independently, starting around 10,000 years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wild ancestor of chickens is generally agreed to be a tropical bird still living in the forests of Southeast Asia called the red junglefowl –  with other junglefowl species possibly adding to the genetic mix. From these origins, humans have carried chickens around the world over the past two millennia or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, eggs dramatically predate chickens. But to be fair to the spirit of the riddle, we should also consider whether a chicken’s egg predates a chicken. As humans consistently chose the tamest red junglefowls and bred them together, the genetic makeup of the resulting birds will have shifted. At some stage during this domestication process the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) evolved into a new subspecies, Gallus gallus domesticus, AKA the chicken.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it is impossible to pinpoint the moment when this happened. But in theory, at some point two junglefowl bred and their offspring was genetically different enough from the species of its parents to be classified as a chicken. This chicken would have developed within a junglefowl egg and only produced the very first chicken’s egg on reaching maturity. Looked at this way, the chicken came first.\n",
