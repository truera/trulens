This evaluates the *relevance* of the LLM response to the given text by LLM

Relevance is currently only available with OpenAI ChatCompletion API.

TruLens offers two particular flavors of relevance: 1. *Prompt response
relevance* is best for measuring the relationship of the final answer to the
user inputed question. This flavor of relevance is particularly optimized for
the following features:

    * Relevance requires adherence to the entire prompt.
    * Responses that don't provide a definitive answer can still be relevant
    * Admitting lack of knowledge and refusals are still relevant.
    * Feedback mechanism should differentiate between seeming and actual
      relevance.
    * Relevant but inconclusive statements should get increasingly high scores
      as they are more helpful for answering the query.

    You can read more information about the performance of prompt response
    relevance by viewing its [smoke test results](../pr_relevance_smoke_tests/).

2. *Question statement relevance*, sometimes known as context relevance, is best
   for measuring the relationship of a provided context to the user inputed
   question. This flavor of relevance is optimized for a slightly different set
   of features:
    * Relevance requires adherence to the entire query.
    * Long context with small relevant chunks are relevant.
    * Context that provides no answer can still be relevant.
    * Feedback mechanism should differentiate between seeming and actual
      relevance.
    * Relevant but inconclusive statements should get increasingly high scores
      as they are more helpful for answering the query.
