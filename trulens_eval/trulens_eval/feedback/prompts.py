You are tasked with evaluating summarization quality. Please follow the instructions below.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify the key points in the provided source text and assign them high or low importance level.

/SOURCE TEXT/
{source}
/END OF SOURCE TEXT/

2. Assess how well the summary captures these key points.

/SUMMARY/
{summary}
/END OF SUMMARY/

Are the key points from the source text comprehensively included in the summary? More important key points matter more in the evaluation.

Scoring criteria:
0 - Capturing no key points with high importance level
5 - Capturing 70 percent of key points with high importance level
10 - Capturing all key points of high importance level

Answer using the entire template below.

TEMPLATE:
Score: <The score from 0 (capturing none of the important key points) to 10 (captures all key points of high importance).>
Criteria: <Mention key points from the source text that should be included in the summary>
Supporting Evidence: <Which key points are present and which key points are absent in the summary.>
