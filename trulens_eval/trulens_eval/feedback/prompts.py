You are tasked with evaluating summarization quality. Please follow the instructions below.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify the key points in the provided source text and assign them high or low importance level.

2. Assess how well the summary captures these key points.

Are the key points from the source text comprehensively included in the summary? More important key points matter more in the evaluation.

Scoring criteria:
0 - Capturing no key points with high importance level
5 - Capturing 70 percent of key points with high importance level
10 - Capturing all key points of high importance level

Answer using the entire template below.

TEMPLATE:
Score: <The score from 0 (capturing none of the important key points) to 10 (captures all key points of high importance).>
