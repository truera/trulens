# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# It's worth noting that this call to `declare_component` is the
# *only thing* you need to do to create the binding between Streamlit and
# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a

# Create a wrapper function for the component. This is an optional
# best practice - we could simply expose the component function returned by
# `declare_component` and call it done. The wrapper allows us to customize
# our component's API: we can pre-process its input args, post-process its
# output value, and add a docstring for users.

    Parameters
    ----------
    record_json: obj
        JSON of the record serialized by `json.loads`.
    
    app_json: obj
        JSON of the app serialized by `json.loads`.

    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.

    Returns
    -------
    string
        Start time of the selected component in the application. If the whole app is selected,
        this returns a JavaScript null, which is interpreted in python as a 0.
