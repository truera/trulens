Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an emerging paradigm that augments LLMs with a knowledge base – a source of truth set of docs often stored in a vector database like Pinecone, to mitigate this problem. To build an effective RAG-style LLM  application, it is important to experiment with various configuration choices while setting up the vector database and study their impact on performance metrics.\n",
