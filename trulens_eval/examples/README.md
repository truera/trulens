# Examples

The top-level organization of this examples repository is divided into
**quickstarts** and **expositions**. Quickstarts are actively maintained to work
with every release. Expositions are verified to work with a set of verified
dependencies tagged at the top of the notebook which will be updated at every
*major* release.

Quickstarts contain the simple examples for critical workflows to build,
evaluate and track your LLM app.

This expositional library of TruLens examples is organized by the component of
interest. Components include `/models`, `/frameworks` and `/vector-dbs`.

For end to end application examples, checkout `/end2end_apps`.
