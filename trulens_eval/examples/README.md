# Examples

The top-level organization of this examples repository is divided into
**quickstarts**, **expositions**, **experimental**, and **dev**. Quickstarts are
actively maintained to work with every release. Expositions are verified to work
with a set of verified dependencies tagged at the top of the notebook which will
be updated at every *major* release. Experimental examples may break between
release. Dev examples are used to develop or test releases.

Quickstarts contain the simple examples for critical workflows to build,
evaluate and track your LLM app.

This expositional library of TruLens examples is organized by the component of
interest. Components include `/models`, `/frameworks` and `/vector-dbs`.

For end to end application examples, checkout `/end2end_apps`.
