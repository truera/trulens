    "\n",
    "Query planning is a useful tool to leverage the ability of LLMs to structure the user inputs into multiple different queries, either sequentially or in parallel before answering the questions. This method improvers the response by allowing the question to be decomposed into smaller, more answerable questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-question queries are one such method. Sub-question queries decompose the user input into multiple different sub-questions. This is great for answering complex questions that require knowledge from different documents.\n",

She finds that all the doors are locked, so she sadly walks down the middle of the hall. Suddenly, she finds a little three-legged table with a tiny golden key on it. She tries the key in the locks of the doors, but it does not fit. On her second time round, she finds a low curtain and a little door behind it. The key fits the lock, and Alice opens the door to find a small passage that leads to a beautiful garden. However, she is too large to fit through the doorway. She then finds a bottle on the table with a label that says \"DRINK ME,\" so she tastes it and finds it to be a mixture of different flavors. After drinking it, she shrinks to a size that allows her to fit through the doorway. She then hears a voice outside and realizes it is the Rabbit looking for her. The Rabbit tries to open the door, but Alice's elbow is pressed against it, so it fails. The Rabbit then decides to try and get in through the window, but Alice stops it by making a snatch in the air. She hears the Rabbit and another voice, which turns out to be Pat, discussing how to get in. Eventually, Pat is sent down the chimney.\n",
