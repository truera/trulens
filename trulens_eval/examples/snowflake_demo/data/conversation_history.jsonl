Not only do they help purify the air, but they also create a calming atmosphere. You can opt for different types of plants - from smaller succulents to larger indoor trees - and place them in beautiful planters or stands throughout your home.\n\n2. **Update lighting fixtures**: Swapping out outdated or basic lighting fixtures with more stylish or unique options can instantly elevate the look of a room. Consider adding floor lamps, table lamps, or pendant lights that complement your interior design style. For example, if you have a minimalist style, a sleek and modern floor lamp would be an excellent choice.\n\n3. **Layer textiles and textures**: Incorporate different textiles and textures to create depth and interest in your living spaces.
