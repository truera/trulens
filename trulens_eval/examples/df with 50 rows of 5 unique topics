Up to five authorized computers and an unlimited number of iPods could play the files. Burning the files with iTunes as an audio CD, then re-importing would create music files without the DRM.

5a8c870efd22b3001a8d8a19,Database,"The first task of a database designer is to produce a conceptual data model that reflects the structure of the information to be held in the database.

Designing a good conceptual data model requires a good understanding of the application domain; it typically involves asking deep questions about the things of interest to an organisation, like ""can a customer also be a supplier?"", or ""if a product is sold with two different forms of packaging, are those the same product or different products?"", or ""if a plane flies from New York to Dubai via Frankfurt, is that one flight or two (or maybe even three)?"".

Nobbs in 1884, a Methodist church was formed and in 1891 a Seventh-day Adventist congregation led by one of Nobbs' sons. Some unhappiness with G. H. Nobbs, the more organised and formal ritual of the Church of England service arising from the influence of the Melanesian Mission, decline in spirituality, the influence of visiting American whalers, literature sent by Christians overseas impressed by the Pitcairn story, and the adoption of Seventh-day Adventism by the descendants of the mutineers still on Pitcairn, all contributed to these developments.

572f5d6ea23a5019007fc5aa,Database,"Physically, database servers are dedicated computers that hold the actual databases and run only the DBMS and related software. Database servers are usually multiprocessor computers, with generous memory and RAID disk arrays used for stable storage. RAID is used for recovery of data if any of the disks fail. Hardware database accelerators, connected to one or more servers via a high-speed channel, are also used in large volume transaction processing environments. DBMSs are found at the heart of most database applications. DBMSs may be built around a custom multitasking kernel with built-in networking support, but modern DBMSs typically rely on a standard operating system to provide these functions. from databases before the inception of Structured Query Language (SQL). The data recovered was disparate, redundant and disorderly, since there was no proper method to fetch it and arrange it in a concrete structure.[citation needed]",What is required for a modern DBMS to function?,"{'text': ['standard operating system'], 'answer_start': [654]}"

Instead of records being stored in some sort of linked list of free-form records as in CODASYL, Codd's idea was to use a ""table"" of fixed-length records, with each table used for a different type of entity. A linked-list system would be very inefficient when storing ""sparse"" databases where some of the data for any one record could be left empty. The relational model solved this by splitting the data into a series of normalized tables (or relations), with optional elements being moved out of the main table to where they would take up room only if needed.
