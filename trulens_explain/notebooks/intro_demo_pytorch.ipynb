Internal Influence is implemented by the `InternalInfluence` class in the `attribution` module.\n",

For neuron explanations, the attributions can take the shape of the output or input of a specific network layer. The default behavior is to create attributions for the output of a layer, but this can be specified via the `anchor` in the `Cut` class. See the [Slice](https://truera.github.io/trulens/api/slices/) documentation for more detail.\n",

Depending on the particular record and application, different `blur` and `threshold` parameters may be appropriate.\n",
