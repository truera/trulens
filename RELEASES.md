## 0.29.0

## Breaking Changes

In this release, we re-aligned the groundedness feedback function with other LLM-based feedback functions. It's now faster and easier to define a groundedness feedback function, and can be done with a standard LLM provider rather than importing groundedness on its own. In addition, the custom groundedness aggregation required is now done by default.

Before:

```python
from trulens_eval.feedback.provider.openai import OpenAI
from trulens_eval.feedback import Groundedness

provider = OpenAI() # or any other LLM-based provider
grounded = Groundedness(groundedness_provider=provider)
f_groundedness = (
    Feedback(grounded.groundedness_measure_with_cot_reasons, name = "Groundedness")
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.rets.collect())
    .on_output()
    .aggregate(grounded.grounded_statements_aggregator)
)
```

After:

```python
provider = OpenAI()
f_groundedness = (
    Feedback(provider.groundedness_measure_with_cot_reasons, name = "Groundedness")
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.rets.collect())
    .on_output()
)
```

This change also applies to the NLI-based groundedness feedback function available from the Huggingface provider.

Before:

```python
from trulens_eval.feedback.provider.openai import Huggingface
from trulens_eval.feedback import Groundedness

from trulens_eval.feedback.provider import Huggingface
huggingface_provider = Huggingface()
grounded = Groundedness(groundedness_provider=huggingface_provider)

f_groundedness = (
    Feedback(grounded.groundedness_measure_with_cot_reasons, name = "Groundedness")
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.rets.collect())
    .on_output()
    .aggregate(grounded.grounded_statements_aggregator)
)
```

After:

```python
from trulens_eval.feedback import Feedback
from trulens_eval.feedback.provider.hugs = Huggingface

huggingface_provider = Huggingface()

f_groundedness = (
    Feedback(huggingface_provider.groundedness_measure_with_nli, name = "Groundedness")
    .on(Select.RecordCalls.retrieve.rets.collect())
    .on_output()
)
```
