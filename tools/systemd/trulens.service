# Example of a systemd service file to start the trulens leaderboard on system
# start.
# These need to be changed to adapt to your deployment:
# - user: currently "ubuntu"
# - repo folder: currently "/home/ubuntu/trulens"
# - conda setup script: currently "init_conda.sh" which is based on miniconda
#   installation to /home/ubuntu/miniconda3
# - conda environment: currently py311_trulens

# To use this service, move it to /etc/systemd/system
# Then run `sudo systemctl enable trulens`
# Then run `sudo systemctl start trulens`

# If things are going wrong, you can see the problems with
# `journalctl -u trulens`
