To focus on the words more, we need to adjust the **baseline** used in the integrated gradients computation. By default in the instantiation so far, the baseline for each token is a zero vector of the same shape as its embedding. By making the basaeline be identicaly to the explained instances on special tokens, we can rid their impact from our measurement.
