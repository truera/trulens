The use of `trulens` for visualization will be introduced. This notebook also demonstrates some of the text processing that might be useful for some NLP projects though we will not go over those details during the lab sessions. In the process we will investigate the bias of a sentiment model towards/against particular baseball teams; by the end of the first lab we should find tweets that have strangely differing sentiments according to a model of interest on tweets suchs as:\n","\n","- \"*redsox* are really playing\"\n","- \"*yankees* are really playing\"\n","\n","Students should be able to:\n","\n","- realize that NLP models are easy to get and use, especially using `huggingface`,\n","- learn the structure of typical NLP pipelines,\n","- learn how to use `trulens` for visualization and attributions (next week), and\n","- use this notebook for ideas and/or coding tips when doing NLP projects.\n","\n","You need to run this notebook with a \"runtime\" feature a GPU. You can \"change runtime type\" in the \"Runtime\" menu above. Evaluate the next few cells but their details do not need discussion.
